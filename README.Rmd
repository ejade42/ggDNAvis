# ggDNAvis

ggDNAvis is an R package that uses ggplot2 to visualise genetic data of three main types:

(1) a single DNA/RNA sequence split across multiple lines,

(2) multiple DNA/RNA sequences, each occupying a whole line, or

(3) base modifications such as DNA methylation called by modified-bases models in Dorado or Guppy.

This is accomplished through main functions `visualise_single_sequence()`, `visualise_many_sequences()`, and `visualise_methylation()` respectively. Each of these has helper sequences for streamlined data processing, as detailed later in the section for each visualisation type.

Additionally, ggDNAvis contains a built-in example dataset (`example_many_sequences`) and a set of colour palettes for DNA visualisation (`sequence_colour_palettes`).

Note that all spellings are the British English version (e.g. "colour", "visualise"). Aliases have not been defined, meaning American spellings will not work.

# Loading data

## Introduction to `example_many_sequences`
ggDNAvis comes with example dataset `example_many_sequences`. In this data, each row/observation represents one read. Reads are associated with metadata such as the participant and family to which they belong, and with sequence data such as the DNA sequence, FASTQ quality scores, and modification information retrieved from the MM and ML tags in a SAM/BAM file.

```{r}
## View the first 4 rows of example_many_sequences data
github_table(head(example_many_sequences, 4))
```

The DNA sequence in column `sequence` is the information used for visualising single/multiple sequences. For visualising DNA modification, this data contains information on both 5-cytosine-methylation and 5-cytosine-hydroxymethylation. For a given modification type (e.g. methylation), visualisation requires a column of locations and a column of probabilities. In this dataset, the relevant columns are `methylation_locations` and `methylation_probabilities` for methylation and `hydroxymethylation_locations` and `hydroxymethylation_probabilities` for hydroxymethylation.

Locations are stored as a comma-condensed string of integers for each read, produced via `vector_to_string()`, and indicate the indices along the read at which the probability of modification was assessed. For example, methylation might be assessed at each CpG site, which in the read `"GGCGGCGGAGGCGGCGGA"` would be the third, sixth, twelfth, and fifteenth bases, thus the location string would be `"3,6,12,15"` for that read.

Probabilities are also a comma-condensed string of integers produced via `vector_to_string()`, but here each integer represents the probability that the corresponding base is modified. Probabilities are stored as 8-bit integers (0-255) where a score of $N$ represents the probability space from $\frac{N}{256}$ to $\frac{N+1}{256}$. For the read above, a probability string of `"250,3,50,127"` would indicate that the third base is almost certainly methylated (97.66%-98.05%), the sixth base is almost certainly not methylated (1.17%-1.56%), the twelfth base is most likely not methylated (19.53%-19.92%), and the fifteenth base may or may not be methylated (49.61%-50.00%)

```{r}
## Function to convert integer scores to corresponding percentages
convert_8bit_to_decimal_prob <- function(x) {
    return(c(  x   / 256, 
             (x+1) / 256))
}

## Convert comma-condensed string back to numerical vector
## string_to_vector() and vector_to_string() are crucial ggDNAvis helpers
probabilities <- string_to_vector("250,3,50,127")

## For each probability, print 8-bit score then percentage range
for (probability in probabilities) {
    percentages <- round(convert_8bit_to_decimal_prob(probability), 4) * 100
    cat("8-bit probability: ", probability, "\n", sep = "")
    cat("Decimal probability: ", percentages[1], "% - ", percentages[2], "%", "\n\n", sep = "")
}
```

## Introduction to `string_to_vector()` and `vector_to_string()`

Lots of the data used in ggDNAvis requires a series of multiple values to be stored within a single observation in a dataframe. The solution used here is condensing vectors to a single string (character value) for simple storage, then reconstituting the original vectors when needed. These functions are basic wrappers around `strsplit()` and `paste(, collapse = ",")` but are easy to use and readable.

Additionally, these can be used when reading SAM/BAM MM and ML tags, which are stored as comma-separated lists within modified FASTQ files, so can also be processed using these functions.

```{r}
vector_to_string(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
string_to_vector("1,2,3,4") # the default vector type is numeric

vector_to_string(c("these", "are", "some", "words"))
string_to_vector("these,are,some,words", type = "character")

vector_to_string(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
string_to_vector("TRUE,FALSE,TRUE", type = "logical")
```

If multiple strings (i.e. a character vector) are input to `string_to_vector()`, it will concatenate them and produce a single output vector. This is intended, useful behaviour to help with some of the visualisation code in this package. If a list of separate vectors for each input value is desired, `lapply()` can be used.

```{r}
string_to_vector(c("1,2,3", "4,5,6"))
lapply(c("1,2,3", "4,5,6"), string_to_vector)
```

## Loading from FASTQ and metadata file

### Standard FASTQ

To read in a normal FASTQ file (containing a read ID/header, sequence, and quality scores for each read), the function `read_fastq()` can be used. The example data file for this is `inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_raw.fastq`

```{r}
## Look at first 16 lines of FASTQ
fastq_raw <- readLines("inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_raw.fastq")
for (i in 1:16) {
    cat(fastq_raw[i], "\n")
}

## Load data from FASTQ
fastq_data <- read_fastq("inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_raw.fastq", calculate_length = TRUE)

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(fastq_data, 4))
```
Using the basic `read_fastq()` function returns a dataframe with read ID, sequence, and quality columns. Optionally, a `sequence_length` column can be generated by setting `calculate_length = TRUE`. However, we can see that some of the sequences (e.g. F1-1c) are reversed. This occurs when the read is of the - strand at the biochemical level. 

To convert reverse reads to their forward equivalents, and incorporate additional data such as the participant and family to which each read belongs, we will make use of a metadata file located at `inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_metadata.csv`

```{r}
## Load metadata from CSV
metadata <- read.csv("inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_metadata.csv")

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(metadata, 4))
```

We see that this metadata file contains the same `read` column with the same unique read IDs and a `direction` column specifying whether each read is `"forward"` or `"reverse"`. These two columns are mandatory. Additionally, we have family and participant ID columns providing additional information on each read.

Note: the `direction` column can be produced manually. However, for large data volumes it may be more effective to use SAMtools to write TXT files of all forward and reverse read IDs via the -F/-f 16 flags, e.g.:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
## bash/shell code for using SAMtools on the command line:

## See the samtools flag documentation for more details on why
## -F 16 selects forward reads and -F 16 selects reverse reads
samtools view -F 16 ${input_bam_file} | \
awk '{print $1}'  > "forward_reads.txt"

samtools view -f 16 ${input_bam_file} | \
awk '{print $1}'  > "reverse_reads.txt"
```

Then simply read the lines from each file and use that to assign directions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Use files from last step to construct vectors of forward and reverse IDs
forward_reads <- readLines("forward_reads.txt")
reverse_reads <- readLines("reverse_reads.txt")

## Use rep() to add a direction column
constructed_metadata <- data.frame(
    read = c(forward_reads, reverse_reads),
    direction = c(rep("forward", length(forward_reads)),
                  rep("reverse", length(reverse_reads)))
    )
```

In any case, once we have metadata with the `read` and `direction` columns, we can use `merge_fastq_with_metadata()` to combine the metadata and the fastq data. Crucially, this function uses the `direction` column of the metadata to determine which reads are reverse, and reverse-complements these reverse reads only to produce a new column containing the forward version of all reads:

```{r}
## Merge fastq data with metadata
## This function reverse-complements reverse reads to get all forward versions
merged_fastq_data <- merge_fastq_with_metadata(fastq_data, metadata)

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(merged_fastq_data, 4))
```

Now we have a `forward_sequence` column (scroll to the right if you can't see it!). We can now reformat this data to be exactly the same as the included `example_many_sequences` data:

```{r}
## Subset to only the columns present in example_many_sequences
merged_fastq_data <- merged_fastq_data[, c("family", "individual", "read", "forward_sequence", "sequence_length", "forward_quality")]

## Rename "forward_sequence" to "sequence" and same for quality
colnames(merged_fastq_data)[c(4,6)] <- c("sequence", "quality")

## View first 4 rows of data produced from files
github_table(head(merged_fastq_data, 4))

## View first 4 rows of example_many_sequences (with modification columns excluded)
github_table(head(example_many_sequences[, 1:6], 4))

## Check if equal
identical(merged_fastq_data, example_many_sequences[, 1:6])
```

So, from just a standard FASTQ file and a simple metadata CSV we have successfully reproduced the example_many_sequences data (excluding methylation/modification information) via `read_fastq()` and `merge_fastq_with_metadata()`. We can also write from this dataframe to FASTQ using `write_fastq()`:

```{r}
## Use write_fastq with filename = NA and return = TRUE to create the FASTQ, 
## but return it as a character vector rather than writing to file.
output_fastq <- write_fastq(merged_fastq_data, 
                            filename = NA, return = TRUE,
                            read_id_colname = "read", 
                            sequence_colname = "sequence",
                            quality_colname = "quality")
## View first 16 lines
for (i in 1:16) {
    cat(output_fastq[i], "\n")
}
```

### Modified FASTQ (e.g. methylation)

FASTQ files can be extended to include DNA modification (most often 5-cytosine-methylation) information within the header rows. Most often, this information comes from Nanopore long-read sequencing being basecalled with a modification-capable model in Guppy or Dorado, resulting in SAM or BAM files. In SAM/BAM files, modification information is stored in the MM and ML tags. These can be copied to the header rows of a FASTQ file via 

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
samtools fastq -T MM,ML ${input_bam_file} > "modified_fastq_file.fastq"
```

ggDNAvis then contains tools for reading from, processing, and writing to these modified FASTQ files. The example data file for this is `inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_raw_modified.fastq`

```{r}
## Look at first 16 lines of FASTQ
modified_fastq_raw <- readLines("inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_raw_modified.fastq")
for (i in 1:16) {
    cat(modified_fastq_raw[i], "\n")
}
```

This file is identical to the standard FASTQ seen in \@ref(standard-fastq) in the sequence and quality lines, but has the MM and ML tags stored in the header. See the [SAM tags specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf) or the documentation for `read_modified_fastq()`, `merge_methylation_with_metadata()`, and `reverse_locations_if_needed()` for a comprehensive explanation of how these store methylation/modification information.

The modification information stored in these FASTQ header lines can be parsed with `read_modified_fastq()`. This converts the locations from the SAM/BAM MM format to simply being the indices along the read at which modification was assessed (starting indexing at 1). For example, in F1-1a, the `C+m?` (methylation) locations start `"3,6,9,12"`, indicating that the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth bases in the read were assessed for probability of methylation. Checking the sequence, we see that all of these are CpG sites (CG dinucleotides), which are the main DNA methylation sites in the genome. For each assessed site, the modification probability is given as an 8-bit integer (0-255), where 0 represents ~0% modification probability and 255 represents ~100% modification probability (this is fully explained in \@ref(introduction-to-example_many_sequences)).

```{r}
## Load data from FASTQ
methylation_data <- read_modified_fastq("inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_raw_modified.fastq")

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(methylation_data, 4))
```

Ultimately, `read_modified_fastq()` outputs a dataframe with the standard read information (ID, sequence, length, quality), a column stating which modification types were assessed for each read (e.g. `"C+h?"` for hydroxymethylation or `"C+m?"` for methylation - refer to the [SAM tags specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMtags.pdf)), and for each modification type, a column of assessed locations (indices along the read) and a column of modification probabilities (as 8-bit integers).

Modification types, locations, and probabilities are all stored as comma-condensed strings produced from vectors via `vector_to_string()`. These can be converted back to vectors via `string_to_vector()` - see \@ref(introduction-to-string_to_vector-and-vector_to_string).

As with the standard FASTQ, some of the reads in the modified FASTQ are reverse. However, as the assessed modification locations are indices along the read and the probabilities correspond to locations in sequence, the modification information needs to be reversed in addition to reverse complementing the DNA sequence. Analogous to before, this is achieved via the `merge_methylation_with_metadata()` function.

```{r}
## Load metadata from CSV
metadata <- read.csv("inst/extdata/example_many_sequences_metadata.csv")

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(metadata, 4))
```

The metadata is identical to previously (\@ref(standard-fastq)).

```{r}
## Merge fastq data with metadata
## This function reverse-complements reverse reads to get all forward versions
## And correctly flips location and probability information
## See ?merged_methylation_data and ?reverse_locations_if_needed for details
merged_methylation_data <- merge_methylation_with_metadata(methylation_data, metadata)

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(merged_methylation_data, 4))
```

The merged methylation data contains `forward_` rows for sequence and quality, as before, but also for hydroxymethylation and methylation locations and probabilities. However, looking at the modification locations columns (scroll right on the table), we can see that the indices assessed for modification are 4, 7, 10 etc for sequence `"GGCGGCGGCGGC..."`. This is because the actual biochemical modification was on the Cs on the reverse strand, corresponding to Gs on the forward strand according to Watson-Crick base pairing. For many purposes, it may be desirable to keep these positions to indicate that in reality, the modification occurred at exactly that location on the other strand. This is accomplished by setting `offset = 0` (the default) inside `merge_methylation_with_metadata()`.

However, there is also the option to offset the modification locations by 1. For symmetrical modification sites such as CGs, this means that when the C on the reverse strand is modified, that gets attributed to the *C* on the forward strand even though the direct complementary base is the G. The advantage of this is that it means CG sites (i.e. potential methylation sites) always have 5-methylcytosine modifications associated with the C of each CG, regardless of which strand the information came from. This is also often useful, as it ensures the information is consistent and (provided locations are palindromic when reverse-complemented) modifications are always attached to the correct base e.g. C-methylation to C. This is accomplished by setting `offset = 1` inside `merge_methylation_with_metadata()`.

***Either of these options can be valid and useful, but make sure you think about it!***

```{r, echo = FALSE}
{
cat("Here the stars represent the true biochemical modifications on the reverse strand:
(occurring at the Cs of CGs in the 5'-3' direction)\n\n\n")
cat("5'  GGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGA  3'\n")
cat("3'  CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCT  5'\n")
cat("       *  *  *  *  *      \n")
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
{
cat("If we take the complementary locations on the forward strand,
the modification locations correspond to Gs rather than Cs,
but are in the exact same locations:\n\n")
cat("       o  o  o  o  o      \n")
cat("5'  GGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGA  3'\n")
cat("3'  CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCT  5'\n")
cat("       *  *  *  *  *      \n")
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
{
cat("If we offset the locations by 1 on the forward strand,
the modifications are always associated with the C of a CG,
but the locations are moved slightly:\n\n")
cat("      o  o  o  o  o       \n")
cat("5'  GGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGA  3'\n")
cat("3'  CCGCCGCCGCCGCCGCCT  5'\n")
cat("       *  *  *  *  *      \n")
}
```

We will proceed with `offset = 1` so that the forward versions match up with `example_many_sequences`.

```{r}
## Merge fastq data with metadata, offsetting reversed locations by 1
merged_methylation_data <- merge_methylation_with_metadata(methylation_data, 
                                                           metadata, 
                                                           reversed_location_offset = 1)

## View first 4 rows
github_table(head(merged_methylation_data, 4))
```

Now, looking at the methylation and hydroxymethylation locations we see that the forward-version locations are 3, 6, 9, 12..., corresponding to the Cs of CGs. This makes the reversed reverse read consistent with the forward reads. 

We can now extract the relevant columns and demonstrate that this new dataframe read from modified FASTQ and metadata CSV is exactly the same as `example_many_sequences`.

```{r}
## Subset to only the columns present in example_many_sequences
merged_methylation_data <- merged_methylation_data[, c("family", "individual", "read", "forward_sequence", "sequence_length", "forward_quality", "forward_C+m?_locations", "forward_C+m?_probabilities", "forward_C+h?_locations", "forward_C+h?_probabilities")]

## Rename "forward_sequence" to "sequence" and same for quality
colnames(merged_methylation_data)[c(4,6:10)] <- c("sequence", "quality", "methylation_locations", "methylation_probabilities", "hydroxymethylation_locations", "hydroxymethylation_probabilities")

## View first 4 rows of data produced from files
github_table(head(merged_methylation_data, 4))

## View first 4 rows of example_many_sequences
github_table(head(example_many_sequences, 4))

## Check if equal
identical(merged_methylation_data, example_many_sequences)
```
So, from  a modified FASTQ file and the metadata CSV we have successfully reproduced the example_many_sequences data *including* methylation/modification information via `read_modified_fastq()` and `merge_methylation_with_metadata()`. And similarly to before, we can write back to a modified FASTQ file via `write_modified_fastq()`.

```{r}
## Use write_modified_fastq with filename = NA and return = TRUE to create 
## the FASTQ, but return it as a character vector rather than writing to file.
output_fastq <- write_modified_fastq(merged_methylation_data, 
                                     filename = NA, return = TRUE,

# Visualising a single DNA/RNA sequence

ggDNAvis can be used to visualise a single DNA sequence via `visualise_single_sequence()`. This function is extremely simple, just taking a DNA sequence as input. We will use the *NOTCH2NLC* repeat expansion sequence of F1-1 from Figure 1 of @sone_long-read_2019.

```{r}
## Define sequence variable
sone_2019_f1_1_expanded <- "GGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGAGGAGGAGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGC"

## Use all default settings
visualise_single_sequence(sone_2019_f1_1_expanded)
```

By default, `visualise_single_sequence()` will return a ggplot object. It can be useful to view this for instant debugging. However, it is not usually rendered at a sensible scale or aspect ratio. Therefore, it is preferable to set a `filename = <file_to_write_to.png>` for export, as the function has built-in logic for scaling correctly (with resolution configurable via the `pixels_per_base` argument). We don't have a use for interactive debugging, so we will also set `return = FALSE`.

```{r}
## Create image
visualise_single_sequence(sone_2019_f1_1_expanded, 
                          filename = "README_files/output/single_sequence_01.png", 
                          return = FALSE)
