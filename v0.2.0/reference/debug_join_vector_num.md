# Print a numeric vector to console (`ggDNAvis` debug helper)

Takes a numeric vector, and prints it to the console separated by
`", "`.  
  
This allows the output to be copy-pasted into a vector within an R
script. Used for taking vector outputs and then writing them as literals
within a script.  
  
E.g. when given input `1:5`, prints `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which can be
directly copy-pasted within [`c()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html) to
input that vector. Printing normally via `print(1:5)` instead prints
`[1] 1 2 3 4 5`, which is not valid vector input so can't be copy-pasted
directly.  
  
See
[`debug_join_vector_str()`](https://ejade42.github.io/ggDNAvis/reference/debug_join_vector_str.md)
for the equivalent for character/string vectors.

## Usage

``` r
debug_join_vector_num(vector)
```

## Arguments

- vector:

  `numeric vector`. Usually generated by some other function. This
  function allows copy-pasting the output to directly create a vector
  with this value.

## Examples

``` r
debug_join_vector_num(1:5)
#> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```
