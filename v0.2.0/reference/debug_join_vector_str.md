# Print a character/string vector to console (`ggDNAvis` debug helper)

Takes a character/string vector, and prints it to the console separated
by `", "`.  
  
This allows the output to be copy-pasted into a vector within an R
script. Used for taking vector outputs and then writing them as literals
within a script.  
  
E.g. when given input `strsplit("ABCD", split = "")[[1]]`, prints
`"A", "B", "C", "D"`, which can be directly copy-pasted within
[`c()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html) to input that vector. Printing
normally via `print(strsplit("ABCD", split = "")[[1]])` instead prints
`[1] "A" "B" "C" "D"`, which is not valid vector input so can't be
copy-pasted directly.  
  
See
[`debug_join_vector_num()`](https://ejade42.github.io/ggDNAvis/reference/debug_join_vector_num.md)
for the equivalent for numeric vectors.

## Usage

``` r
debug_join_vector_str(vector)
```

## Arguments

- vector:

  `character vector`. Usually generated by some other function. This
  function allows copy-pasting the output to directly create a vector
  with this value.

## Examples

``` r
debug_join_vector_str(c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
#> "A", "B", "C", "D"
```
