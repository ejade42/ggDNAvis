* Initial CRAN submission.

* Initial functionality: 

    * Visualise single DNA sequences, multiple DNA 
    sequences, and DNA modification (e.g. methylation).

    * Read and write FASTQ, including modified FASTQ 
    produced with -T MM,ML that stores modification 
    information in the header rows.

    * Intelligently merge with metadata including read
    direction, and reverse all information for reverse reads
    only to make all reads "forward" versions.
