Title: ggplot2-Based Tools For Visualising DNA Sequences And Modifications

Description: Uses ggplot2 to visualise either (a) a single DNA/RNA sequence split across multiple lines, (b) multiple DNA/RNA sequences, each occupying a whole line, or (c) base modifications such as DNA methylation called by modified bases models in Dorado or Guppy. Functions starting with `visualise_<something>()` are the main plotting functions, and functions starting with `extract_<something>()` are key helper functions for reading files and reformatting data.
