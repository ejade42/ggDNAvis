<dl><dt id="arg-sequence-dataframe">sequence_dataframe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sequence-dataframe"></a></dt>
<dd><p><code>dataframe</code>. A dataframe containing the sequence information and all required meta-data. See <code><a href="example_many_sequences.html">example_many_sequences</a></code> for an example of a compatible dataframe.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sequence-variable">sequence_variable<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sequence-variable"></a></dt>
<dd><p><code>character</code>. The name of the column within the dataframe containing the sequence information to be output. Defaults to <code>"sequence"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-grouping-levels">grouping_levels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-grouping-levels"></a></dt>
<dd><p><code>named character vector</code>. What variables should be used to define the groups/chunks, and how large a gap should be left between groups at that level. Set to <code>NA</code> to turn off grouping.<br><br> Defaults to <code>c("family" = 8, "individual" = 2)</code>, meaning the highest-level groups are defined by the <code>family</code> column, and there is a gap of 8 between each family. Likewise the second-level groups (within each family) are defined by the <code>individual</code> column, and there is a gap of 2 between each individual.<br><br> Any number of grouping variables and gaps can be given, as long as each grouping variable is a column within the dataframe. It is recommended that lower-level groups are more granular and subdivide higher-level groups (e.g. first divide into families, then into individuals within families). <br><br> To change the order of groups within a level, make that column a factor with the order specified e.g. <code>example_many_sequences$family &lt;- factor(example_many_sequences$family, levels = c("Family 2", "Family 3", "Family 1"))</code> to change the order to Family 2, Family 3, Family 1.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sort-by">sort_by<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sort-by"></a></dt>
<dd><p><code>character</code>. The name of the column within the dataframe that should be used to sort/order the rows within each lowest-level group. Set to <code>NA</code> to turn off sorting within groups.<br><br> Recommended to be the length of the sequence information, as is the case for the default <code>"sequence_length"</code> which was generated via <code>example_many_sequences$sequence_length &lt;- nchar(example_many_sequences$sequence)</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-desc-sort">desc_sort<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-desc-sort"></a></dt>
<dd><p><code>logical</code>. Boolean specifying whether rows within groups should be sorted by the <code>sort_by</code> variable descending (<code>TRUE</code>, default) or ascending (<code>FALSE</code>).</p></dd>

</dl></div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="value">Value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#value"></a></h2>
