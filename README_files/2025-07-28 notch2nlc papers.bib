As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

We describe the use of programmable targeted long-read sequencing with Oxford Nanopore’s ReadUntil function for parallel genotyping of all known neuropathogenic STRs in a single assay. Our approach enables accurate, haplotype-resolved assembly and DNA methylation profiling of STR sites, from a list of predetermined candidates. This correctly diagnoses all individuals in a small cohort (n = 37) including patients with various neurogenetic diseases (n = 25). Targeted long-read sequencing solves large and complex STR expansions that confound established molecular tests and short-read sequencing and identifies noncanonical STR motif conformations and internal sequence interruptions. We observe a diversity of STR alleles of known and unknown pathogenicity, suggesting that long-read sequencing will redefine the genetic landscape of repeat disorders. Last, we show how the inclusion of pharmacogenomic genes as secondary ReadUntil targets can further inform patient care.},

	abstract = {Due to the high clinical heterogeneity of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), it is easy to misdiagnose this condition and is considered to be a rare progressive neurodegenerative disease. More evidence demonstrates that NIID involves not only the central nervous system but also multiple systems of the body and shows a variety of symptoms, which makes a clinical diagnosis of NIID more difficult. This review summarizes the clinical symptoms in different systems and demonstrates that NIID is a multiple-system intranuclear inclusion disease. In addition, the core triad symptoms in the central nervous system, such as dementia, parkinsonism, and psychiatric symptoms, are proposed as an important clue for the clinical diagnosis of NIID. Recent studies have demonstrated that expanded GGC repeats in the 5′-untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene are the cause of NIID. The genetic advances and possible underlying mechanisms of NIID (expanded GGC repeat-induced DNA damage, RNA toxicity, and polyglycine-NOTCH2NLC protein toxicity) are briefly summarized in this review. Interestingly, inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammation were observed in the affected tissues of patients with NIID. As a downstream pathological process of NIID, inflammation could be a therapeutic target for NIID.},

	abstract = {Microsatellites are repeated DNA sequences of 3–6 nucleotides highly variable in length and sequence and that have important roles in genomes regulation and evolution. However, expansion of a subset of these microsatellites over a threshold size is responsible of more than 50 human genetic diseases. Interestingly, some of these disorders are caused by expansions of similar sequences, sizes and localizations and present striking similarities in clinical manifestations and histopathological features, which suggest a common mechanism of disease. Notably, five identical CGG repeat expansions, but located in different genes, are the causes of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 1 to 3 (OPDM1-3) and oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy (OPML), which are neuromuscular and neurodegenerative syndromes with overlapping symptoms and similar histopathological features, notably the presence of characteristic eosinophilic ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions. In this review we summarize recent finding in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and FXTAS, where the causing CGG expansions were found to be embedded within small upstream ORFs (uORFs), resulting in their translation into novel proteins containing a stretch of polyglycine (polyG). Importantly, expression of these polyG proteins is toxic in animal models and is sufficient to reproduce the formation of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions. These data suggest the existence of a novel class of human genetic pathology, the polyG diseases, and question whether a similar mechanism may exist in other diseases, notably in OPDM and OPML.},

By long-read sequencing, we identified a GGC repeat expansion in the 5′ region of NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) in all affected family members. Furthermore, we found similar expansions in 8 unrelated families with NIID and 40 sporadic NIID cases. We observed abnormal anti-sense transcripts in fibroblasts specifically from patients but not unaffected individuals.

We screened for GGC repeat expansions in a cohort of 1,011 PD patients and identified 11 patients with intermediate-length repeat expansions ranging from 41 to 52 repeats, with no repeat expansions in 1,134 controls. Skin biopsy revealed phospho-alpha-synuclein deposition, confirming the PD diagnosis in 2 patients harboring intermediate-length repeat expansions instead of NIID or essential tremor. Fibroblasts from PD patients harboring intermediate-length repeat expansions revealed NOTCH2NLC upregulation and autophagic dysfunction.

Surprisingly, GGC repeat expansion was observed in two Alzheimer disease (AD)-affected families and three parkinsonism-affected families, implicating that the GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC could also contribute to the pathogenesis of both AD and PD.

The expansion of GGC repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC has been associated with various neurogenerative disorders of the central nervous system and, more recently, oculopharyngodistal myopathy. This study aimed to report patients with distal weakness with both neuropathic and myopathic features on electrophysiology and pathology who present GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC.

Methods
Whole‐exome sequencing (WES) and long‐read sequencing were implemented to identify the candidate genes. In addition, the available clinical data and the pathological changes associated with peripheral nerve and muscle biopsies were reviewed and studied.

Results
We identified and validated GGC repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC in three unrelated patients who presented with progressive weakness predominantly affecting distal lower limb muscles, following negative results in an initial WES. We found intranuclear inclusions with multiple proteins deposits in the nuclei of both myofibers and Schwann cells. The clinical features of these patients are compatible with the diagnosis of distal motor neuropathy and rimmed vacuolar myopathy.

Interpretation
These phenotypes enrich the class of features associated with NOTCH2NLC‐related repeat expansion disorders (NRED), and provide further evidence that the neurological symptoms of NRED include not only brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves damage, but also myopathy, and that overlapping symptoms might exist.},

Trinucleotide repeat expansions in LRP12 or GIPC1 were recently reported to be associated with OPDM. However, a significant portion of OPDM patients have unknown genetic causes. In this study, long-read whole-genome sequencing and repeat-primed PCR were performed and we identified GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene in 16.7\% (4/24) of a cohort of Chinese OPDM patients, designated as OPDM type 3 (OPDM3). Methylation analysis indicated that methylation levels of the NOTCH2NLC gene were unaltered in OPDM3 patients, but increased significantly in asymptomatic carriers. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that NOTCH2NLC mRNA levels were increased in muscle but not in blood of OPDM3 patients. Immunofluorescence on OPDM muscle samples and expressing mutant NOTCH2NLC with (GGC)69 repeat expansions in HEK293 cells indicated that mutant NOTCH2NLC-polyglycine protein might be a major component of intranuclear inclusions, and contribute to toxicity in cultured cells. In addition, two RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP A/B and MBNL1, were both co-localized with p62 in intranuclear inclusions in OPDM muscle samples. These results indicated that a toxic protein gain-of-function mechanism and RNA gain-of-function mechanism may both play a vital role in the pathogenic processes of OPDM3. This study extended the spectrum of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion-related diseases to a predominant myopathy phenotype presenting as OPDM, and provided evidence for possible pathogenesis of these diseases.},

	abstract = {This scientific commentary refers to ‘Expansion of GGC repeat in human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor’ by Sun et al. (doi: 10.1093/brain/awz372).The family of repeat expansion disorders currently comprises over 30 members, more than half of which were discovered in the 1990s (Fig. 1) (Bahlo et al., 2018; Paulson, 2018). The advent of second-generation sequencing allowed the genetic basis of many other human diseases to be unravelled over the next 15 years using high-throughput technologies. However, these technologies were confined to short-read sequencing and were inefficient at detecting structural variants, including repeat expansions. More recently, new methods have emerged for the detection of repeat expansions including third-generation sequencing that provides longer, continuous sequences. This has resulted in a renaissance of research into the genetic basis of repeat expansion disorders and the discovery of eight novel pathogenic repeats in the last 3 years (Fig. 1). Among these, expanded GGC repeats in the non-coding region at the very beginning of the NOTCH2NLC gene have been shown by three independent research groups to cause neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) (Ishiura et al., 2019; Sone et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019). NIID is a complex sporadic or dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder, presenting with a wide range of ages at onset (AAO; infancy to adulthood) and with various combinations of dementia, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Neuroimaging and neuropathological hallmarks of NIID include high-intensity signals in diffusion-weighted imaging in the corticomedullary junction and eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions (seen in the nervous system, other tissues, and skin biopsies). In this issue of Brain, Sun and co-workers report a fourth discovery of expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC, this time in patients with essential tremor (Sun et al., 2020).},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the cells of the visceral organs as well as central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system cells. Recently, a GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been identified as the etiopathological agent of NIID. Interestingly, this GGC repeat expansion was also reported in some patients with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, there are no autopsy-confirmed cases of concurrent NIID and ALS.

Case presentation
A 60-year-old Taiwanese woman reported a four-month history of progressive weakness beginning in the right foot that spread to all four extremities. She was diagnosed with ALS because she met the revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for definite ALS with upper and lower motor neuron involvement in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions. She died of respiratory failure at 22 months from ALS onset, at the age of 62 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lesions in the medial part of the cerebellar hemisphere, right beside the vermis (paravermal lesions). The subclinical neuropathy, indicated by a nerve conduction study (NCS), prompted a potential diagnosis of NIID. Antemortem skin biopsy and autopsy confirmed the coexistence of pathology consistent with both ALS and NIID. We observed neither eccentric distribution of p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the areas with abundant large motor neurons nor cytopathological coexistence of ALS and NIID pathology in motor neurons. This finding suggested that ALS and NIID developed independently in this patient.

Conclusions
We describe a case of concurrent NIID and ALS discovered during an autopsy. Abnormal brain MRI findings, including paravermal lesions, could indicate the coexistence of NIID even in patients with ALS showing characteristic clinical phenotypes.},

Increasing studies were conducted to verify the relationship between NOTCH2NLC gene and many neurological diseases, such as neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, essential tremor, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and even oculopharyngodistal myopathy. Thus, we support the concept, NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders (NRED), to summarize all diseases with the GGC repeat expansion in the 5’UTR of NOTCH2NLC gene, regardless of their various clinical phenotypes. Here, we discuss the reported cases to analyze the clinical features of NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders, including dementia, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy and myopathy, leukoencephalopathy, and essential tremor. In addition, we outline radiological and pathological manifestations of NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders, and then present possible mechanisms, such as toxic polyG protein, toxic repeat RNA, the GGC repeat size, and the size and types of trinucleotide interruption. Therefore, this review provides a systematic description of NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders and emphasizes the significance for understanding this type of repeat expansion disease.},

To understand the molecular pathogenesis of NIID, here, we established both a transgenic mouse model and a human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) model. Expression of the NOTCH2NLC with expanded GGC repeats produced widespread intranuclear and perinuclear polyglycine (polyG), polyalanine (polyA), and polyarginine (polyR) inclusions, leading to behavioral deficits and severe neurodegeneration, which faithfully mimicked the clinical and pathological features associated with NIID. Furthermore, conserved alternative splicing events were identified between the NIID mouse and hNPC models, among which was the enrichment of the binding motifs of hnRNPM, an RNA binding protein known as alternative splicing regulator. Expanded NOTCH2NLC-polyG and NOTCH2NLC-polyA could interact with and sequester hnRNPM, while overexpression of hnRNPM could ameliorate the cellular toxicity. These results together suggested that dysfunction of hnRNPM could play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of NIID.},

NIID has been considered to be a heterogeneous disease because of the highly variable clinical manifestations, and ante-mortem diagnosis has been difficult. However, since we reported the usefulness of skin biopsy for the diagnosis of NIID, the number of NIID diagnoses has increased, in particular adult-onset NIID. In this study, we studied 57 cases of adult-onset NIID and described their clinical and pathological features. We analysed both NIID cases diagnosed by post-mortem dissection and by ante-mortem skin biopsy based on the presence of characteristic eosinophilic, hyaline and ubiquitin-positive intanuclear inclusion: 38 sporadic cases and 19 familial cases, from six families. In the sporadic NIID cases with onset age from 51 to 76, dementia was the most prominent initial symptom (94.7\%) as designated ‘dementia dominant group’, followed by miosis, ataxia and unconsciousness. Muscle weakness and sensory disturbance were also observed. It was observed that, in familial NIID cases with onset age less than 40 years, muscle weakness was seen most frequently (100\%), as designated ‘limb weakness group’, followed by sensory disturbance, miosis, bladder dysfunction, and dementia. In familial cases with more than 40 years of onset age, dementia was most prominent (100\%). Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and abnormal nerve conduction were frequently observed in both sporadic and familial NIID cases. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed high intensity signal in corticomedullary junction in diffusion-weighted image in both sporadic and familial NIID cases, a strong clue to the diagnosis. All of the dementia dominant cases presented with this type of leukoencephalopathy on head magnetic resonance imaging. Both sporadic and familial NIID cases presented with a decline in Mini-Mental State Examination and Frontal Assessment Battery scores. Based on these clinicopathological features, we proposed a diagnosis flow chart of adult-onset NIID. Our study suggested that the prevalence rate of adult-onset NIID may be higher than previously thought, and that NIID may be underdiagnosed. We should take NIID into account for differential diagnosis of leukoencephalopathy and neuropathy.},

It has been considered to be a heterogeneous disease entity because the clinical pictures of previously described cases were highly variable. In the present review, reported NIHID cases have been categorized into three clinical subgroups according to onset and disease duration, and the clinical phenotype of each subgroup is discussed. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) in NIHID are ubiquitinated and their prevalence is inversely correlated with neuronal loss, suggesting that NII formation is a protective mechanism involving the ubiquitin–proteasome-dependent proteolytic pathway. In several polyglutamine diseases, disease-related proteins containing abnormally expanded polyglutamine tracts aggregate in neuronal nuclei, resulting in NII formation. The similarity between NII in NIHID and polyglutamine diseases suggests that they are formed during a common proteolysis-related process that takes place in the nucleus. Although the pathogenetic mechanism underlying NIHID remains unknown, the data reviewed here suggest that it might be related to accumulation of as yet unidentified abnormal proteins or dysfunction of the intranuclear ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) used to be considered as a neurodegenerative disease. Due to the availability of skin biopsy, the diagnostic efficiency of the disease has been greatly improved. Recently, researchers have successfully identified that the GGC repeat expansion in the 5′-untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene is the causative mutation of NIID. Besides the typical phenotype of brain degeneration, peripheral neuropathy, and autonomic disturbance, the gene mutation is also associated with Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, essential tremor, adult leukoencephalopathy, and oculopharyngodistal myopathy. However, it still needs more studies to elucidate whether those variable NIID phenotypes can categorize into NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion related disorders. We update the discovery milestone, clinical phenotype, laboratory examinations, as well as new insight into the diagnosis and treatment of NIID. NIID is an unusual degenerative disease that can involve multiple systems, especially involves the nervous system. Originally, it is named after the pathological characteristics with extensive intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions in central and peripheral nervous tissues, as well as in multiple other organs (Sone et al., Brain 139:3170–3186, 2016). In 2019, several research teams from China and Japan have simultaneously identified that the GGC repeat expansion in the 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene is the pathogenic mutation of NIID (Ishiura et al., Nat Genet 51:1222–1232, 2019; Deng et al., J Med Genet 56:758–764, 2019; Sone et al., Nat Genet 51:1215–1221, 2019; Sun et al., Brain 143:222–233, 2020; Tian et al., Am J Hum Genet 105:166–176, 2019). Since then, the number of reported NIID cases is rapidly increasing, and the spectrum of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion related disorders is significantly broadening (Westenberger and Klein, Brain 143:5–8, 2020). However, the NIID associated with GGC repeat expansion of the NOTCH2NLC gene might be account for a part of patients, probably more frequently in the Asian population, because this expansion has not been identified in an European series with postmortem confirmed NIID cases (Chen et al., Ann Clin Transl Neurol 2020). In order to better understand of the disease, we need to revisit the current state of NIID in combination with the findings based on our experiences in recent years and update the concepts about the clinical and pathogenic progression of NIID.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear hyaline inclusion disease (NIHID) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder pathologically characterized by localized neuronal loss, and the presence of eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in neurons and glial cells. NIHID is a heterogeneous disease entity. It is divided into three clinical subgroups: infantile, juvenile and adult forms. Recently, reports of adult-onset cases have increased. Typical adult-onset NIHID consists of cognitive dysfunction with leukoencephalopathy. This type of adult-onset NIHID can be predicted by characteristic magnetic resonance images, high intensity areas on T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and persistent high intensity at the corticomedullary junction in diffusion-weighted images. When clinically suspected, the ante-mortem diagnosis can be made by biopsy. In adult-onset NIHID, nuclear inclusions are found more frequently in glial cells, and moderate to severe white matter degeneration is often associated. Although the underlying pathological mechanisms of NIHID are largely unknown, abnormal intranuclear accumulations of proteins and/or dysfunction of protein degradation systems might be related to the pathogenesis. To further clarify the characteristics of this disease entity, biological and pathological analysis of the patients is indispensable. As this disease entity becomes better known, diagnosed cases are expected to increase. Adult-onset NIHID might not be as extremely rare as previously thought.

	abstract = {Improvements in sequencing technology coupled with dramatic declines in the cost of genome sequencing have led to a proportional growth in the size and number of genetic datasets since the release of the human genetic sequence by The Human Genome Project (HGP) international consortium. The HGP was undeniably a significant scientific success, a turning point in human genetics and the beginning of human genomics. This burst of genetic information has led to a greater understanding of disease pathology and the potential of employing this data to deliver more precise patient care. Hence, the recognition of high-penetrance disease-causing mutations which encode drivers of disease has made the management of most diseases more specific. Nonetheless, while genetic scores are becoming more extensively used, their application in the real world is expected to be limited due to the lack of diversity in the data used to construct them. Underrepresented populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income individuals, and those living in rural areas, often experience greater health disparities and worse health outcomes compared to the general population. These disparities are often the result of systemic barriers, such as poverty, discrimination, and limited access to healthcare. Addressing health inequity in underrepresented populations requires addressing the underlying social determinants of health and implementing policies and programs which promoted health equity and reduce disparities. This can include expanding access to affordable healthcare, addressing poverty and unemployment, and promoting policies that combat discrimination and racism.},

	abstract = {Taiwanese aborigines have been deemed the ancestors of Austronesian speakers which are currently distributed throughout two-thirds of the globe. As such, understanding their genetic distribution and diversity as well as their relationship to mainland Asian groups is important to consolidating the numerous models that have been proposed to explain the dispersal of Austronesian speaking peoples into Oceania. To better understand the role played by the aboriginal Taiwanese in this diaspora, we have analyzed a total of 451 individuals belonging to nine of the tribes currently residing in Taiwan, namely the Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Tsou, and the Yami from Orchid Island off the coast of Taiwan across 15 autosomal short tandem repeat loci. In addition, we have compared the genetic profiles of these tribes to populations from mainland China as well as to collections at key points throughout the Austronesian domain. While our results suggest that Daic populations from Southern China are the likely forefathers of the Taiwanese aborigines, populations within Taiwan show a greater genetic impact on groups at the extremes of the current domain than populations from Indonesia, Mainland, or Southeast Asia lending support to the “Out of Taiwan” hypothesis. We have also observed that specific Taiwanese aboriginal groups (Paiwan, Puyuma, and Saisiyat), and not all tribal populations, have highly influenced genetic distributions of Austronesian populations in the pacific and Madagascar suggesting either an asymmetric migration out of Taiwan or the loss of certain genetic signatures in some of the Taiwanese tribes due to endogamy, isolation, and/or drift.

Until recently, it was often considered simply as a unique compartment containing the genetic information of the cell and associated machinery, without much attention to its structure and mechanical properties. This article provides compelling examples that illustrate how specific nuclear structures are associated with important cellular functions, and how defects in nuclear mechanics can cause a multitude of human diseases. During differentiation, embryonic stem cells modify their nuclear envelope composition and chromatin structure, resulting in stiffer nuclei that reflect decreased transcriptional plasticity. In contrast, neutrophils have evolved characteristic lobulated nuclei that increase their physical plasticity, enabling passage through narrow tissue spaces in their response to inflammation. Research on diverse cell types further demonstrates how induced nuclear deformations during cellular compression or stretch can modulate cellular function. Pathological examples of disturbed nuclear mechanics include the many diseases caused by mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and associated proteins, as well as cancer cells that are often characterized by abnormal nuclear morphology. In this article, we will focus on determining the functional relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular (dys-)function, describing the molecular changes associated with physiological and pathological examples, the resulting defects in nuclear mechanics, and the effects on cellular function. New insights into the close relationship between nuclear mechanics and cellular organization and function will yield a better understanding of normal biology and will offer new clues into therapeutic approaches to the various diseases associated with defective nuclear mechanics.},

In this review, we summarize recent developments in the inheritance features, pathogenesis, and histopathologic and radiologic features of NIID that subvert the previous perceptions of NIID. GGC repeat sizes determine the age of onset and clinical phenotypes of NIID patients. Anticipation may be absent in NIID but paternal bias is observed in NIID pedigrees. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in skin tissues once considered pathological hallmarks of NIID can also present in other GGC repeat diseases. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity along the corticomedullary junction once considered the imaging hallmark of NIID can frequently be absent in muscle weakness and parkinsonism phenotype of NIID. Besides, DWI abnormalities can appear years after the onset of predominant symptoms and may even disappear completely with disease progression. Moreover, continuous reports of NOTCH2NLC GGC expansions in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases lead to the proposal of a new concept of NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders (NRED). However, by reviewing the previous literature, we point out the limitations of these studies and provide evidence that these patients are actually suffering from neurodegenerative phenotypes of NIID.},

However, an increasing number of reports of NOTCH2NLC GGC expansions in patients with Alzheimer disease, essential tremor, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and oculopharyngodistal myopathy have led to the proposal of a new concept known as NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders (NREDs). The majority of studies have mainly focused on screening for NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat variation in populations previously diagnosed with the associated disease, subsequently presenting it as a novel causative gene for the condition. These studies appear to be clinically relevant but do have their limitations because they may incorrectly regard the lack of MRI abnormalities as an exclusion criterion for NIID or overlook concomitant clinical presentations not typically observed in the associated diseases. Besides, in many instances within these reports, patients lack pathologic evidence or undergo long-term follow-up to conclusively rule out NIID. In this review, we will systematically review the research on NOTCH2NLC 5′ untranslated region GGC repeat expansions and their association with related neurologic disorders, explaining the limitations of the relevant reports.

The varying phenotypes can be so distinctive that they would seem to have differing biology. Because the same phenotypes can have multiple causes, including different gene mutations, there may be multiple molecular mechanisms causing ALS, implying that the disease is a syndrome. Conversely, multiple phenotypes can be caused by a single gene mutation; thus, a single molecular mechanism could be compatible with clinical heterogeneity. The pathogenic mechanism(s) in ALS remain unknown, but active propagation of the pathology neuroanatomically is likely a primary component.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease with highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations. The present study aimed to characterize clinical features and propose a classification system based on a large cohort of NIID in China.
Methods
The Chinese NIID registry was launched from 2017, and participants' demographics and clinical features were recorded. Brain MRI, skin pathologies, and the number of GGC repeat expansions in the 5′ untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene were evaluated in all patients.
Results
In total, 223 patients (64.6\% female) were recruited; the mean (SD) onset age was 56.7 (10.3) years. The most common manifestations were cognitive impairment (78.5\%) and autonomic dysfunction (70.9\%), followed by episodic symptoms (51.1\%), movement disorders (50.7\%), and muscle weakness (25.6\%). Imaging markers included hyperintensity signals along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (96.6\%), white matter lesions (98.1\%), paravermis (55.0\%), and focal cortical lesions (10.1\%). The median size of the expanded GGC repeats in these patients was 115 (range, 70–525), with 2 patients carrying {\textgreater}300 GGC repeats. A larger number of GGC repeats was associated with younger age at onset (r = −0.329, p {\textless} 0.0001). According to the proposed clinical classification based on the most prominent manifestations, the patients were designated into 5 distinct types: cognitive impairment-dominant type (34.1\%, n = 76), episodic neurogenic event-dominant type (32.3\%, n = 72), movement disorder-dominant type (17.5\%, n = 39), autonomic dysfunction-dominant type (8.5\%, n = 19), and neuromuscular disease-dominant type (7.6\%, n = 17). Notably, 32.3\% of the episodic neurogenic event-dominant type of NIID has characteristic focal cortical lesions on brain MRI presenting localized cortical edema or atrophy. The mean onset age of the neuromuscular disease-dominant type was 47.2 (17.6) years, younger than the other types (p {\textless} 0.001). There was no significant difference in the sizes of GGC repeats among the patients in the 5 types (p = 0.547, Kruskal-Wallis test).
Discussion
This observational study of NIID establishes an overall picture of the disease regarding clinical, imaging, and genetic characteristics. The proposed clinical classification of NIID based on the most prominent manifestation divides patients into 5 types.},

Despite decades of intense research and over 50 potentially causative or disease-modifying genes identified, etiology remains unexplained and treatment options remain limited for the majority of ALS patients. Various factors have contributed to the slow progress in understanding and developing therapeutics for this disease. Here, we review the genetic basis of ALS, highlighting factors that have contributed to the elusiveness of genetic heritability. The most commonly mutated ALS-linked genes are reviewed with an emphasis on disease-causing mechanisms. The cellular processes involved in ALS pathogenesis are discussed, with evidence implicating their involvement in ALS summarized. Past and present therapeutic strategies and the benefits and limitations of the model systems available to ALS researchers are discussed with future directions for research that may lead to effective treatment strategies outlined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We analyzed the clinical features of 25 NIID patients from 24 unrelated families and performed skin biopsy and/or sural nerve biopsy on 24 probands. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length PCR were conducted to detect GGC repeats of NOTCH2NLC. Onset age ranged from 24 to 72 years old, and the disease duration ranged from 12 h to 25 years with the mode of onset characterized as acute, recurrent or chronic progressive type. Tremor was a common phenotype, often observed in the early stages, next to dementia and paroxysmal encephalopathy. Symptoms infrequently reported such as oromandibular dystonia, recurrent vomiting, dizziness and headache of unknown origin, as well as pure peripheral neuropathy were also suggestive of NIID. Reversible leukoencephalopathy following encephalitic episodes and the absence of apparent DWI abnormality were noticed. Two genetically confirmed NIID patients failed to be identified intranuclear inclusions, and one patient was simultaneously found significant mitochondrial swelling and fingerprint profiles depositing in lysosomes. All the patients were identified abnormal GGC repeats of NOTCH2NLC. We identify some atypical clinicopathological features and consider that pathological examinations combined with genetic testing is the gold standard for diagnosis. Whether lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of NIID deserves further study.},

Methods We performed an extensive literature research to identify all original articles reporting frequencies of C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS mutations in ALS. The mutation frequency and effect size of each study were combined. Possible sources of heterogeneity across studies were determined by meta-regression, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis.
Results 111 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled mutation frequencies of these major ALS-related genes were 47.7\% in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) and 5.2\% in sporadic ALS (SALS). A significant difference was identified regarding the frequencies of mutations in major ALS genes between European and Asian patients. In European populations, the most common mutations were the C9orf72 repeat expansions (FALS 33.7\%, SALS 5.1\%), followed by SOD1 (FALS 14.8\%, SALS 1.2\%), TARDBP (FALS 4.2\%, SALS 0.8\%) and FUS mutations (FALS 2.8\%, SALS 0.3\%), while in Asian populations the most common mutations were SOD1 mutations (FALS 30.0\%, SALS 1.5\%), followed by FUS (FALS 6.4\%, SALS 0.9\%), C9orf72 (FALS 2.3\%, SALS 0.3\%) and TARDBP (FALS 1.5\%, SALS 0.2\%) mutations.
Conclusions These findings demonstrated that the genetic architecture of ALS in Asian populations is distinct from that in European populations, which need to be given appropriate consideration when performing genetic testing of patients with ALS.},

Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is clinically distinct from OPDM but is also caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in NOTCH2NLC, which may be an indicator of intranuclear inclusion in skin biopsy. We investigated the presence of intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies from patients with OPDM and muscle diseases with a similar pathology to evaluate whether they will have similar diagnostic findings on skin biopsy. Methods We analysed the frequency of p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in sweat gland cells, adipocytes and fibroblasts in skin biopsy samples from patients with OPDM (OPDM\_NOTCH2NLC [n = 2], OPDM\_GIPC1 [n = 6] and OPDM\_LRP12 [n = 3]), NIID (n = 1), OPMD (n = 1), IBM (n = 4) and GNE myopathy (n = 2). Results The p62-postive intranuclear inclusions were observed in all three cell types in both patients with OPDM\_NOTCH2NLC and a patient with NIID, in at least one cell type in all six patients with OPDM\_GIPC1, and all in three cell types in one of the three patients with OPDM\_LRP12. These findings were not observed in patients with OPMD, IBM or GNE myopathy.

              Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adolescent or adult-onset neuromuscular disease that is characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscle weakness.

                have been reported to be disease-causing genes in OPDM, namely OPDM1, OPDM2, OPDM3 and OPDM4, accordingly. So far, limited studies have suggested that CGG repeat expansion within the pathogenic range may play a key role in the pathogenesis of OPDM with the gain-of-function mechanism at the RNA and/or protein level, while repeat expansion over a threshold limit may cause hypermethylation, leading to the transcriptional silencing of the CGG repeats in the expanded allele, which results in the existence of mild phenotype or asymptomatic carriers.

NIID is caused by an expansion of GGC repeats in the 5′ UTR of the NOTCH2NLC (N2C) gene. We found that these repeats are embedded in a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) (uN2C), resulting in their translation into a polyglycine-containing protein, uN2CpolyG. This protein accumulates in intranuclear inclusions in cell and mouse models and in tissue samples of individuals with NIID. Furthermore, expression of uN2CpolyG in mice leads to locomotor alterations, neuronal cell loss, and premature death of the animals.

NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was rarely identified in patients of European ancestry, whereas the actual prevalence of the expansion in European patients may be potentially higher than reported, and the CGG repeats in LRP12/GIPC1 are suggested to be screened in European patients with NIID. The repeat size and interruptions in NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion confer pleiotropic effects on clinical phenotype, a pure and stable ET phenotype may be an early symptom of NIID, and GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC possibly give rise to ET. An association may also exist between intermediate-length NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion and patients affected by PD and ET. NOTCH2NLC-OPDM highly resembles NOTCH2NLC-NIID, the two disorders may be the variations of a single neurodegenerative disease, and there may be a disease-causing upper limit in size of GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC, repeats over which may be non-pathogenic. The haploinsufficiency of NOTCH2NLC may not be primarily involved in NOTCH2NLC-related disorders and a toxic gain-of-function mechanism possibly drives the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in patients with NOTCH2NLC-associated disorders.},

	abstract = {Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Background GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC has been recently linked to neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) via unknown disease mechanisms. Herein, we explore the genetic origin of the sporadic cases and toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism in NIID.
Methods Multiple genetic screenings were performed on NIID individuals and their available family members. Methylation status of blood DNA, NOTCH2NLC mRNA level from muscle biopsies and RNA foci from skin biopsies of NIID individuals or asymptomatic carriers were evaluated and compared.
Results In two sporadic NIID families, we identified two clinically and pathologically asymptomatic fathers carrying large GGC repeat expansion, above 300 repeats, with offspring repeat numbers of 172 and 148, respectively. Further evaluation revealed that the GGC repeat numbers in the sperm from two asymptomatic fathers were only 63 and 98, respectively. The CpG island in NOTCH2NLC of the asymptomatic carriers was hypermethylated, and accordingly, the NOTCH2NLC mRNA levels were decreased in the asymptomatic fathers. GGC repeat expansion RNA formed RNA foci and sequestered RNA binding proteins into p62 positive intranuclear inclusions in NIID individuals but not in the control or asymptomatic carrier.
Conclusion Our study suggested the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC might have a disease-causing number ranging from {\textasciitilde}41 to {\textasciitilde}300 repeats. The contraction of GGC repeat expansion in sperm could be a possible mechanism for the paternal-biased origin in some sporadic or recessive inherited NIID individuals. The toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism was identified to be involved in the pathogenicity of this disease.},

	abstract = {The presence of Notch homolog 2 N-terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) repeat expansions are associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID), with varied neurological signs, including neuropathy, ataxia, parkinsonism, and tremor. To date, genetic screening of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats in a cohort with typical Parkinson disease (PD) appears not to have been reported.To investigate if NOTCH2NLC GGC expansions are present in a cohort of patients with PD and controls.This case-control study was conducted in 2 tertiary movement disorder centers in Singapore. Participants were recruited and followed up from January 2005 to January 2020. The presence of NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion repeats was screened using polymerase chain reaction tests, and representative samples were verified with long-read genome sequencing.Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between participants with sporadic PD, healthy control participants, and individuals with NIID.A total of 2076 participants, including 1000 with sporadic PD (600 men [60.0\%]; mean age at onset, 62.6 [7.7] years) and 1076 healthy controls (581 men [54.0\%]; mean age at study recruitment, 54.9 [9.4] years) were recruited. A total of 13 patients with PD and no healthy control participants were identified as carrying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions of more than 40 units; the frequency of more than 40 repeat expansions was higher in participants with PD than controls (P \&lt; .001). None of the patients with PD were carriers of known PD-associated genes. Ten patients with PD carried a GGC expansion of between 41 and 64 repeats (1\% of patients with sporadic PD; mean [SD], 49.4 [9.2] repeats). The other 3 patients carried GGC repeats of 79 or more units, 2 with 122 and 79 repeats, respectively, exhibited typical parkinsonism and were responsive to small dosages of levodopa over many years, with no clinical or imaging features of NIID. The other patient with PD, who had 130 repeats, only developed cognitive impairment before death. Within the GGC expansions, there was no GGA interruptions (mean [SD] GGA percentage in the 3 patients with PD vs patients with NIID, 0\% vs 12\% [9\%]), and the frequency of AGC interruptions was 3 times higher in these patients with PD than patients with NIID (mean [SD], 25\% [12\%] vs 8\% [8\%]).This study demonstrated that individuals with sporadic PD who carried pathogenic NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions can present with typical parkinsonism, requiring only low dosages of levodopa, without displaying other clinical or imaging features of NIID even after several years of follow-up. None of the patients with PD had GGA interruptions within their GGC expansions, and the frequency of AGC interruptions was much higher than that of patients with NIID. The functional significance of a higher moderate repeat expansion in patients with PD compared with healthy controls needs to be further investigated.},

This cross-sectional observational study aimed to characterise the clinical features of NOTCH2NLC-related NIID in China.
Methods Patients with NOTCH2NLC-related NIID underwent an evaluation of clinical symptoms, a neuropsychological assessment, electrophysiological examination, MRI and skin biopsy.
Results In the 247 patients with NOTCH2NLC-related NIID, 149 cases were sporadic, while 98 had a positive family history. The most common manifestations were paroxysmal symptoms (66.8\%), autonomic dysfunction (64.0\%), movement disorders (50.2\%), cognitive impairment (49.4\%) and muscle weakness (30.8\%). Based on the initial presentation and main symptomology, NIID was divided into four subgroups: dementia dominant (n=94), movement disorder dominant (n=63), paroxysmal symptom dominant (n=61) and muscle weakness dominant (n=29). Clinical (42.7\%) and subclinical (49.1\%) peripheral neuropathies were common in all types. Typical diffusion-weighted imaging subcortical lace signs were more frequent in patients with dementia (93.9\%) and paroxysmal symptoms types (94.9\%) than in those with muscle weakness (50.0\%) and movement disorders types (86.4\%). GGC repeat sizes were negatively correlated with age of onset (r=−0.196, p{\textless}0.05), and in the muscle weakness-dominant type (median 155.00), the number of repeats was much higher than in the other three groups (p{\textless}0.05). In NIID pedigrees, significant genetic anticipation was observed (p{\textless}0.05) without repeat instability (p=0.454) during transmission.
Conclusions NIID is not rare; however, it is usually misdiagnosed as other diseases. Our results help to extend the known clinical spectrum of NOTCH2NLC-related NIID.},

For patients at risk, participating in predictive testing and learning of having CAG expansion, a major unanswered question shifts from “Will I get HD?” to “When will it manifest?” Using the largest cohort of HD patients analyzed to date (2913 individuals from 40 centers worldwide), we developed a parametric survival model based on CAG repeat length to predict the probability of neurological disease onset (based on motor neurological symptoms rather than psychiatric onset) at different ages for individual patients. We provide estimated probabilities of onset associated with CAG repeats between 36 and 56 for individuals of any age with narrow confidence intervals. For example, our model predicts a 91\% chance that a 40-year-old individual with 42 repeats will have onset by the age of 65, with a 95\% confidence interval from 90 to 93\%. This model also defines the variability in HD onset that is not attributable to CAG length and provides information concerning CAG-related penetrance rates.},

Previous studies have described that some NIID patients showed clinical and pathological similarities with multiple system atrophy (MSA). This study aimed to address the possibility that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC might be associated with some cases diagnosed as MSA. Methods A total of 189 patients with probable or possible MSA were recruited to screen for GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC by repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). In addition, long-read sequencing (LRS) was performed for all patients with RP-PCR-positive expansion, five patients with RP-PCR-negative expansion, and five controls on the Nanopore platform. Skin biopsies were performed on two patients with GGC expansion. Results Five of 189 patients (2.6\%) were found to have GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC. LRS results identified that the five patients had GGC expansion between 101 and 266, but five patients with RP-PCR-negative expansion and five controls had GGC expansion between 8 and 29. Besides the typical symptoms and signs of MSA, patients with GGC expansion might have longer disease duration, severe urinary retention, and prominent cognitive impairment. In the skin samples from the patients with GGC expansion, typical p62-postive but alpha-synuclein-negative intranuclear inclusions were found in fibroblasts, adipocyte and ductal epithelial cells of sweat glands. Conclusion Trinucleotide GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC could be observed in patients with clinically diagnosed MSA. Adult-onset NIID should be considered as a differential diagnosis of MSA.},

Currently, there are no unbiased estimates of the number of full-mutation FMR1 alleles in the general population; a major obstacle is the lack of an effective screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles in large populations. We have developed a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based screening tool for expanded FMR1 alleles. The method utilizes a chimeric PCR primer that targets randomly within the expanded CGG region, such that the presence of a broad distribution of PCR products represents a positive result for an expanded allele. The method is applicable for screening both males and females and for allele sizes throughout the premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) and full-mutation ranges. Furthermore, the method is capable of rapid detection of expanded alleles using as little as 1\% of the DNA from a single dried blood spot. The methodology presented in this work is suitable for screening large populations of newborn or those at high risk (eg, autism, premature ovarian failure, ataxia, dementia) for expanded FMR1 alleles.

	abstract = {Recently, the (GGC)n repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been identified to be associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Given the clinical overlap of dementia-dominant NIID with neurodegenerative dementia, we therefore hypothesized that the NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion might also contribute to these diseases. In the present study, repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and GC-rich PCR were conducted to detect the repeats of NOTCH2NLC in a cohort of 1004 patients with neurodegenerative dementias from mainland China. As a result, 4 sporadic patients were found to carry the NOTCH2NLC repeats expansion, totally accounting for 0.4\% of all dementia individuals, and the accurate repeated sizes were 110, 133,120 and 76 respectively. Of 4 mutation carriers, three and one were clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) respectively. In addition, 3 out of them revealed leukoencephalopathy in T2-Flair imaging. This study revealed that although rare, the NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions may be associated with AD or FTD-like phenotype as well as leukoencephalopathy.},

Recently, CGG repeat expansions in the noncoding regions of two genes, LRP12 and GIPC1, have been reported to be causative for OPDM. Furthermore, neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) has been recently reported to be caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. We aimed to identify and to clinicopathologically characterize patients with OPDM who have CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM\_NOTCH2NLC). Note that 211 patients from 201 families, who were clinically or clinicopathologically diagnosed with OPDM or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, were screened for CGG expansions in NOTCH2NLC by repeat primed-PCR. Clinical information and muscle pathology slides of identified patients with OPDM\_NOTCH2NLC were re-reviewed. Intra-myonuclear inclusions were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Seven Japanese OPDM patients had CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. All seven patients clinically demonstrated ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and muscle weakness; they myopathologically had intra-myonuclear inclusions stained with anti-poly-ubiquitinated proteins, anti-SUMO1 and anti-p62 antibodies, which were diagnostic of NIID (typically on skin biopsy), in addition to rimmed vacuoles. The sample for EM was available only from one patient, which demonstrated intranuclear inclusions of 12.6 ± 1.6 nm in diameter. We identified seven patients with OPDM\_NOTCH2NLC. Our patients had various additional central and/or peripheral nervous system involvement, although all were clinicopathologically compatible; thus, they were diagnosed as having OPDM and expanding a phenotype of the neuromyodegenerative disease caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC.},

Here we report a genetic study in a cohort of 197 Chinese pedigrees clinically diagnosed with essential tremor. Using a comprehensive strategy combining linkage analysis, whole-exome sequencing, long-read whole-genome sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain reaction, we identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5′ region of the NOTCH2NLC gene that co-segregated with disease in 11 essential tremor families (5.58\%) from our cohort. Clinically, probands that had an abnormal GGC repeat expansion were found to have more severe tremor phenotypes, lower activities of daily living ability. Obvious genetic anticipation was also detected in these 11 essential tremor-positive families. These results indicate that abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5′ region of NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor, and provide strong evidence that essential tremor is a family of diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneities.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives
The GGC repeat expansion in the 5′ untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC was recently identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), which may manifest with peripheral neuropathy. The aim of this study is to investigate its contribution to inherited neuropathy.
Methods
This cohort study screened patients with molecularly undiagnosed Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and healthy controls for the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC using repeat-primed PCR and fragment analysis. The clinical and electrophysiologic features of the patients harboring the GGC repeat expansion were scrutinized. Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry staining and electric microscopic imaging were performed.
Results
One hundred twenty-seven unrelated patients with CMT, including 66 cases with axonal CMT (CMT2), and 200 healthy controls were included. Among them, 7 patients with CMT carried a variant NOTCH2NLC allele with GGC repeat expansion, but it was absent in controls. The sizes of the expanded GGC repeats ranged from 80 to 104 repeats. All 7 patients developed sensory predominant neuropathy with an average age at disease onset of 37.1 years (range 21–55 years). Electrophysiologic studies revealed mild axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Leukoencephalopathy was absent in the 5 patients who received a brain MRI. Skin biopsy from 2 patients showed eosinophilic, ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells and dermal fibroblasts. Two of the 7 patients had a family history of NIID.
Discussion
The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions are an underdiagnosed and important cause of inherited neuropathy. The expansion accounts for 10.6\% (7 of 66) of molecularly unassigned CMT2 cases in the Taiwanese CMT cohort.
Classification of Evidence
This study provides Class III evidence that in Taiwanese patients with genetically undiagnosed CMT, 10.6\% of the CMT2 cases have the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC.},

The most severe neuronal loss and pTDP-43 lesions were seen in lamina IX motor nuclei columns 4, 6, and 8 of lower cervical segments and in columns 9–11 of lumbosacral segments. Severity of pTDP-43 pathology and neuronal loss correlated closely with gray and white matter oligodendroglial involvement and was linked to onset of disease, with severe involvement of columns 4, 6, and 8 of upper extremity onset cases and severe involvement of columns of 9, 10, and 11 in cases with lower extremity onset. Severe TDP-43 lesions and neuronal loss were observed in stage 4 cases and sometimes included Onuf’s nucleus. Notably, three cases displayed pTDP-43 aggregates in the midbrain oculomotor nucleus, which we had not seen previously even in cases with advanced (i.e., stage 4) pathology. pTDP-43 aggregates were observed in neurons of Clarke’s column in 30.6 \% of cases but rarely in the intermediolateral nucleus (IML). Gray matter oligodendroglial pTDP-43 inclusions were present in areas devoid of neuronal pTDP-43 aggregates and neuronal loss. Taken together, our findings indicate that (1) the dorsolateral motor nuclei columns of the cervical and lumbosacral anterior horn may be the earliest foci of pTDP-43 pathology in the spinal cord, (2) gray matter oligodendroglial involvement is an early event in the ALS disease process that possibly heralds subsequent involvement of neurons by pTDP-43 pathology, and (3) in some very advanced cases, there is oculomotor nucleus involvement, which may constitute an additional neuropathological stage (designated here as stage 5) of pTDP-43 pathology in ALS.},

Here, using a comprehensive strategy combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS), long-read whole-genome sequencing (LRS), linkage analysis, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR), and fluorescence amplicon length analysis polymerase chain reaction (AL-PCR), we identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of GIPC1 in one out of four families and three sporadic case subjects from a Chinese OPDM cohort. Expanded GGC repeats were further confirmed as the cause of OPDM in an additional 2 out of 4 families and 6 out of 13 sporadic Chinese individuals with OPDM, as well as 7 out of 194 unrelated Japanese individuals with OPDM. Methylation, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis indicated that GIPC1 mRNA levels were increased while protein levels were unaltered in OPDM-affected individuals. RNA sequencing indicated p53 signaling, vascular smooth muscle contraction, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and ribosome pathways were involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of OPDM-affected individuals with GGC repeat expansion in GIPC1. This study provides further evidence that OPDM is associated with GGC repeat expansions in distinct genes and highly suggests that expanded GGC repeat units are essential in the pathogenesis of OPDM, regardless of the genes in which the expanded repeats are located.},

Here, through a combination of long-read whole-genome sequencing (LRS), repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR), and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR), we found that a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of RILPL1 is associated with familial and simplex OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). The number of repeats ranged from 139 to 197. Methylation analysis indicates that the methylation levels in RILPL1 were unaltered in OPDM4 individuals. Analyses of muscle biopsies suggested that the expanded CGG repeat might be translated into a toxic poly-glycine protein that co-localizes with p62 in intranuclear inclusions. Moreover, analyses suggest that the toxic RNA gain-of-function effects also contributed to the pathogenesis of this disease. Intriguingly, all four types of OPDM have been found to be associated with the CGG repeat expansions located in 5' UTRs. This finding suggests that a common pathogenic mechanism, driven by the CGG repeat expansion, might underlie all cases of OPDM.},

Although repeat expansion in C9orf72 is its most common cause, the pathogenesis of ALS isn’t fully clear. In this study, we show that repeat expansion in LRP12, a causative variant of oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 1 (OPDM1), is a cause of ALS. We identify CGG repeat expansion in LRP12 in five families and two simplex individuals. These ALS individuals (LRP12-ALS) have 61–100 repeats, which contrasts with most OPDM individuals with repeat expansion in LRP12 (LRP12-OPDM), who have 100–200 repeats. Phosphorylated TDP-43 is present in the cytoplasm of iPS cell-derived motor neurons (iPSMNs) in LRP12-ALS, a finding that reproduces the pathological hallmark of ALS. RNA foci are more prominent in muscle and iPSMNs in LRP12-ALS than in LRP12-OPDM. Muscleblind-like 1 aggregates are observed only in OPDM muscle. In conclusion, CGG repeat expansions in LRP12 cause ALS and OPDM, depending on the length of the repeat. Our findings provide insight into the repeat length-dependent switching of phenotypes.},

The native genomic DNA that retains base modification was sequenced on a per-trio basis using both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technologies. A custom workflow was developed to evaluate DNA modifications. With these two technologies combined, long-range DNA methylation information was integrated with complete repeat DNA sequences to investigate the genetic origins of expanded GGC repeats in these sporadic cases.},

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of the GGC‐repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC in whites presenting with movement disorders.

Methods
We searched for the GGC‐repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC using repeat‐primed polymerase chain reaction in 203 patients with essential tremor, 825 patients with PD, 194 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia, 207 patients with “possible” or “probable” MSA, and 336 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA. We also screened 30,008 patients enrolled in the 100,000 Genomes Project for the same mutation using ExpansionHunter, followed by repeat‐primed polymerase chain reaction. All possible expansions were confirmed by Southern blotting and/or long‐read sequencing.

Results
We identified 1 patient who carried the NOTCH2NLC mutation in the essential tremor cohort, and 1 patient presenting with recurrent encephalopathy and postural tremor/parkinsonism in the 100,000 Genomes Project.

Conclusions
GGC‐repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is rare in whites presenting with movement disorders. In addition, existing whole‐genome sequencing data are useful in case ascertainment. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background
Short tandem repeat (STR) expansion disorders are an important cause of human neurological disease. They have an established role in more than 40 different phenotypes including the myotonic dystrophies, Fragile X syndrome, Huntington’s disease, the hereditary cerebellar ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.

Main body
STR expansions are difficult to detect and may explain unsolved diseases, as highlighted by recent findings including: the discovery of a biallelic intronic ‘AAGGG’ repeat in RFC1 as the cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS); and the finding of ‘CGG’ repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and a range of clinical phenotypes. However, established laboratory techniques for diagnosis of repeat expansions (repeat-primed PCR and Southern blot) are cumbersome, low-throughput and poorly suited to parallel analysis of multiple gene regions. While next generation sequencing (NGS) has been increasingly used, established short-read NGS platforms (e.g., Illumina) are unable to genotype large and/or complex repeat expansions. Long-read sequencing platforms recently developed by Oxford Nanopore Technology and Pacific Biosciences promise to overcome these limitations to deliver enhanced diagnosis of repeat expansion disorders in a rapid and cost-effective fashion.

Conclusion
We anticipate that long-read sequencing will rapidly transform the detection of short tandem repeat expansion disorders for both clinical diagnosis and gene discovery.},

	abstract = {Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have been recently introduced to overcome intrinsic limitations of widely-used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, namely the sequencing limited to short-read fragments (150–300 base pairs). Since its introduction, LRS has permitted many successes in unraveling hidden mutational mechanisms. One area in clinical neurology in need of rethinking as it applies to genetic mechanisms is essential tremor (ET). This disorder, among the most common in neurology, is a syndrome often exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance whose large phenotypic spectrum suggest a multitude of genetic etiologies. Exome sequencing has revealed the genetic etiology only in rare ET families (FUS, SORT1, SCN4A, NOS3, KCNS2, HAPLN4/BRAL2, and USP46). We hypothesize that a reason for this shortcoming may be non-classical genetic mechanism(s) underpinning ET, among them trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, or pentanucleotide repeat disorders. In support of this hypothesis, trinucleotide (e.g., GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC) and pentanucleotide repeat disorders (e.g., ATTTC repeats in STARD7) have been revealed as pathogenic in patients with a past history of what has come to be referred to as “ET plus,” bilateral hand tremor associated with epilepsy and/or leukoencephalopathy. A systematic review of LRS in neurodegenerative disorders showed that 10 of the 22 (45\%) genetic etiologies ascertained by LRS include tremor in their phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that future clinical applications of LRS for tremor disorders may uncover genetic subtypes of familial ET that have eluded NGS, particularly those with associated leukoencephalopathy or family history of epilepsy. LRS provides a pathway for potentially uncovering novel genes and genetic mechanisms, helping narrow the large proportion of “idiopathic” ET.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose Recently, the pathogenic and intermediate GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was detected in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, detailed clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological information of clinically diagnosed PD patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC remains scarce. Thus, we aimed to elucidate the clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological characteristics of PD patients carrying the pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. Methods The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was screened in 941 sporadic PD patients and 244 unrelated probands. Comprehensive assessments were performed in three PD patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. The repeat expansion length was estimated using CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted long-read sequencing. Results The three patients (two PD patients from Family 1 and one sporadic PD) carrying the pathogenic NOTCH2NLC expansion were reconfirmed with a diagnosis of clinically established PD. Although they lacked the typical neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature, the typical PD pattern of striatal dopamine transporter loss was detected. Notably, all three patients presented with systemic areflexia, and other secondary causes of polyneuropathy were excluded. Skin biopsy showed intranuclear inclusions and an absence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein deposition in the skin nerve fibers of all three patients. Conclusions Although these clinically diagnosed PD patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC were hardly distinguishable from idiopathic PD based on clinical course and neuroimaging features, the pathological findings indicated that their phenotype was a PD phenocopy of NIID. Systemic areflexia may be an important and unique clinical clue suggesting further genetic testing and skin biopsy examination to confirm the diagnosis of NIID in patients presenting with a PD phenocopy.},

The relationship between the mutation and LMN syndromes has not been reported previously. Here, we identified the GGC repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC in a Chinese familial patient with LMN syndrome, presenting with slowly progressive weakness of four limbs. Needle electromyography revealed evidence of acute denervation and chronic neurogenic changes. Cognition and brain MRI were normal. Initial whole-exome sequencing by next generation sequencing revealed negative results. However, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction performed on the proband showed a pathogenic GGC expansion in the 5'UTR of NOTCH2NLC and long-read sequencing subsequently revealed 248 GGC repeats. The mutation was co-segregated with the clinical phenotype in the family. Immunofluorescent studies identified p62-positive protein deposits in the intranuclear inclusions in myofibers. The GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with a new phenotype of hereditary LMN syndrome. As a result, NOTCH2NLC genotyping should be performed in patients with hereditary LMN syndromes.},

	abstract = {Objective Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 5′-UTR of LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC are associated with OPDM. Despite these advances, approximately 30\% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in two unrelated Chinese Han families. Methods Parametric linkage analysis was performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples. Results The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in the promoter region of RILPL1 was identified in six OPDM patients from two families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the RILPL1 locus in unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples showed no significant differences in RILPL1 mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated RILPL1 transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional transcription from the RILPL1 locus. Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients. Interpretation Our findings implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of RILPL1 as a novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis.

NIID is clinically characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical presentations. To date, the relationship between expanded repeat lengths and clinical phenotype in patients with NIID remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to clarify the genetic and clinical spectrum and their association in patients with NIID. For this purpose, we genetically analyzed Japanese patients with adult-onset NIID with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging findings. Trinucleotide repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC were examined by repeat-primed and amplicon-length PCR. In addition, long-read sequencing was performed to determine repeat size and sequence. The expanded GGC repeats ranging from 94 to 361 in NOTCH2NLC were found in all 15 patients. Two patients carried biallelic repeat expansions. There were marked heterogenous clinical and imaging features in NIID patients. Patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia or urinary dysfunction had a significantly larger GGC repeat size than those without. This significant association disappeared when these parameters were compared with the total trinucleotide repeat number. ARWMC score was significantly higher in patients who had a non-glycine-type trinucleotide interruption within expanded poly-glycine motifs than in those with a pure poly-glycine expansion. These results suggested that the repeat length and sequence in NOTCH2NLC may partly modify some clinical and imaging features of NIID.},

To date, over 60 genes linked to genetic leukoencephalopathies have been discovered through whole-exome sequencing (WES) and long-read sequencing. Nonetheless, the genetic diversity and clinical variability of these disorders among various racial groups remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the genetic spectrum and clinical features of Chinese adult leukoencephalopathies and compare the genetic profiles in different populations.
METHODS: A total of 129 patients suspected of possible genetic leukoencephalopathy were enrolled and underwent WES and dynamic mutation analysis. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the pathogenicity of these mutations. Skin biopsies were conducted for further diagnosis. Genetic data sources from different populations were collected from published articles.
RESULTS: Genetic diagnosis was established in 48.1\% of patients, with WES identifying 57 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 39.5\% of cases. NOTCH3 and NOTCH2NLC were the most common mutated genes, accounting for 12.4\% and 8.5\% of cases, respectively. Dynamic mutation analysis revealed NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions in 8.5\% of patients. Different mutations resulted in varying clinical symptoms and imaging findings. Comparisons of genetic profiles between different populations showed distinct mutational spectrums in adult leukoencephalopathies.
INTERPRETATION: This study highlights the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and improved clinical management of these disorders. It also sheds light on the genetic heterogeneity of adult leukoencephalopathies across different races, emphasizing the need for further research on this topic.},

Brain MRI revealed high-intensity signals at the cerebral corticomedullary junction (diffusion-weighted imaging) and the paravermal area (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), a typical distribution observed in adult onset NIID. The diagnosis was corroborated by skin biopsy, which demonstrated eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, and confirmed by long-read genome sequencing, showing an expansion of the GGC repeat in exon 1 of NOTCH2NLC.

RESULTS: In this study, we performed long-read whole-genome sequencing in a large five-generation family of 156 individuals, including 21 patients diagnosed with typical OPDM. We identified CGG repeat expansions in 5'UTR of RILPL1 gene in all patients we tested while no CGG expansion in unaffected family members. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR were further confirmed the segregation of CGG expansions in other family members and 1000 normal Chinese controls. Methylation analysis indicated that methylation levels of the RILPL1 gene were unaltered in OPDM patients, which was consistent with previous studies. Our findings provide evidence that RILPL1 is associated OPDM in this large pedigree.

However, short-read sequencing methods still have several limitations, such inaccurate genome assembly, the inability to detect large structural variants, and variants located in hard-to-sequence regions like highly repetitive areas. The recently emerged PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) and Oxford nanopore technology (ONT) long-read sequencing (LRS) methods have been shown to overcome most of these technical issues, leading to an increase in diagnostic rate., LRS methods are contributing to the detection of repeat expansions in novel disease-causing genes (e.g., ABCD3, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 causing an Oculopharyngodistal myopathy or PLIN4 causing a Myopathy with rimmed ubiquitin-positive autophagic vacuolation), of structural variants (e.g., in DMD), and of single nucleotide variants in repetitive regions (TTN and NEB). Moreover, these methods have simplified the characterization of the D4Z4 repeats in DUX4, facilitating the diagnosis of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)., We review recent studies that have used either ONT or PacBio SMRT sequencing methods and discuss different types of variants that have been detected using these approaches in individuals with neuromuscular disorders.},

However, the genetic cause of a proportion of pathoclinically confirmed cases remains unknown.
Methods A total of 26 OPDM patients with unknown genetic cause(s) from 4 tertiary referral hospitals were included in this study. Clinical data and laboratory findings were collected. Muscle samples were observed by histological and immunofluorescent staining. Long-read sequencing was initially conducted in six patients with OPDM. Repeat-primed PCR was used to screen the CGG repeat expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in all 26 patients.
Results We identified CGG repeat expansion in the non-coding transcripts of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in another two unrelated Chinese cases with typical pathoclinical features of OPDM. The repeat expansion was more than 70 times in the patients but less than 40 times in the normal controls. Both patients showed no leucoencephalopathy but one showed mild cognitive impairment detected by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Rimmed vacuoles and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) were identified in muscle pathology, and colocalisation of CGG RNA foci with p62 was also found in the INIs of patient-derived fibroblasts.
Conclusions We identified another two unrelated cases with CGG repeat expansion in the long non-coding RNA of the LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 gene, presenting with a phenotype of OPDM. Our cases broadened the recognised phenotypic spectrum and pathogenesis in the disease associated with CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives
GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene are associated with a broad spectrum of progressive neurologic disorders, notably, neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). We aimed to investigate the population-wide prevalence and clinical manifestations of NOTCH2NLC-related disorders in Koreans.

Methods
We conducted a study using 2 different cohorts from the Korean population. Patients with available brain MRI scans from Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) were thoroughly reviewed, and NIID-suspected patients presenting the zigzag edging signs underwent genetic evaluation for NOTCH2NLC repeats by Cas9-mediated nanopore sequencing. In addition, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 3,887 individuals in the Korea Biobank cohort to estimate the distribution of the repeat counts in Koreans and to identify putative patients with expanded alleles and neurologic phenotypes.

Results
In the SNUH cohort, among 90 adult-onset leukoencephalopathy patients with unknown etiologies, we found 20 patients with zigzag edging signs. Except for 2 diagnosed with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and 2 with unavailable samples, all 16 patients (17.8\%) were diagnosed with NIID (repeat range: 87–217). By analyzing the Korea Biobank cohort, we estimated the distribution of repeat counts and threshold ({\textgreater}64) for Koreans, identifying 6 potential patients with NIID. Furthermore, long-read sequencing enabled the elucidation of transmission and epigenetic patterns of NOTCH2NLC repeats within a family affected by pediatric-onset NIID.

Discussion
This study presents the population-wide distribution of NOTCH2NLC repeats and the estimated prevalence of NIID in Koreans, providing valuable insights into the association between repeat counts and disease manifestations in diverse neurologic disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of neurons and the presence of eosinophilic nuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral nervous system, skin and visceral organs. In this paper, we present a case of NIID with recurrent encephalitic attacks that remained stable and nonprogressive for seven years; no such case has previously been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old female was hospitalized due to light-headedness, vomiting, unstable gait and cognitive impairment. Seven years prior, she had experienced an episode of light-headedness, central facial paralysis, unstable gait, aphasia, nausea, vomiting and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness within 12 h, and her other symptoms were completely resolved within one week. During the present hospitalization, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination detected high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the bilateral frontal grey matter-white matter junction. We reviewed the patient's previous MRI results and found that she had also had high signal intensity on DWI of the bilateral frontal grey matter-white matter junction seven years prior. In the intervening seven years, the high signal intensity in the frontal lobes had spread along the grey matter-white matter junction, but the deep white matter remained unaffected. Skin biopsy was performed, and intranuclear inclusions were found in adipocytes, fibroblasts and sweat gland cells. GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) gene confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. She received supportive treatment such as nutrition support therapy and vitamin B and C supplementation, as well as symptomatic treatment during hospitalization. The patient's symptoms were completely relieved within one week.
CONCLUSION: This is a detailed report of a case of NIID with multiple reversible encephalitic attacks, diagnosed by clinical symptoms, intranuclear inclusions, characteristic DWI signals, and genetic tests.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions, which are ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive, in neuronal and somatic cells; this can be observed on skin biopsy. Although patients with NIID present with a variety of symptoms that often make the diagnosis difficult, characteristic high-signal intensity of the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) often provides a clue to the diagnosis of NIID. We present a case of NIID in a 57-year-old woman who only had recurrent vomiting for four years, which is uncommon as the presenting symptom; moreover, DWI showed no apparent abnormality until a slightly abnormal intensity lesion appeared at the right frontal corticomedullary junction seven years after the first episode of recurrent vomiting. Skin biopsies revealed multiple p62-positive nuclear inclusions, and genetic test showed GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC; this may form the genetic basis for NIID. Retrospectively, we found that abnormal cerebellar signals besides the vermis in the fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were detected early-on in the disease. Periodic vomiting may be the only symptom of NIID in the early stages of the disease, and cerebellar abnormalities in FLAIR may serve as an important finding in the diagnosis of NIID, even in the absence of characteristic clinical symptoms or abnormal DWI signals at the cerebral corticomedullary junction., Antibody; Immune disorder; Immune response; Immunoglobulin; Immunology; Inflammation; Nervous system; Neurology; Neuroscience; Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease; Recurrent vomiting; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Cerebellum; Leukoencephalopathy},

	abstract = {Purpose
To report the ocular characteristics of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID)–related retinopathy with expansion of the CGG repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene.

Methods
Seven patients from six families (aged 66–81 years) diagnosed with adult-onset NIID were studied. Ophthalmologic examinations, including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Goldmann perimetry, fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and full-field electroretinography (ERGs), were performed. The expansion of the CGG repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene was determined.

Results
All patients had an expansion of the CGG repeats (length approximately from 330–520 bp) in the NOTCH2NLC gene. The most common symptoms of the five symptomatic cases were reduced BCVA and night blindness. The other two cases did not have any ocular symptoms. The decimal BCVA varied from 0.15 to 1.2. Goldmann perimetry was constricted in all four cases tested; physiological blind spot was enlarged in two of the cases. The FAF images showed an absence of autofluorescence (AF) around the optic disc in all cases and also showed mild hypo-AF or extinguished AF in the midperiphery. In all cases, the OCT images showed an absence of the ellipsoid zone of the photoreceptors in the peripapillary region, and hyperreflective dots were also present between the retinal ganglion cell layer and outer nuclear layer. The macular region was involved in the late stage of the retinopathy. The full-field ERGs showed rod-cone dysfunction.

Conclusions
Patients with adult-onset NIID with CGG repeats expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene had similar ophthalmologic features, including rod-cone dysfunction with progressive retinal degeneration in the peripapillary and midperipheral regions. The primary site is most likely the photoreceptors. Because the ocular symptoms are often overlooked due to dementia and occasionally precede the onset of dementia, detailed ophthalmological examinations are important for the early diagnosis of NIID-related retinopathy.},

	abstract = {Background
The rapidly increasing case reports revealed that neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) had concomitant other system symptoms besides nervous system symptoms. In this study, we systematically evaluated the symptoms, signs, auxiliary examination, and pathological changes in different systems in NIID patients.

Methods
NIID patients were confirmed by examining GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Clinical data of NIID patients including symptoms, signs, and auxiliary examinations were collected for analysis. Ubiquitin and p62 were detected in different tissues from previous surgical samples.

Results
Fifty‐one NIID patients from 17 families were included in this study. Except neurological symptoms, clinical manifestations from other systems were very notable and diverse. The proportions of different system symptoms were 88.2\% in nervous system, 78.4\% in respiratory system, 72.5\% in circulatory system, 72.5\% in locomotor system, 66.7\% in urinary system, 64.7\% in digestive system, 61.5\% in reproductive system, and 50.0\% in endocrine system. In addition, other common symptoms included sexual dysfunction (43.1\%), pupil constriction (56.9\%), blurred vision (51.0\%), and hearing loss (23.5\%). Ubiquitin and p62‐positive cells were found in different tissues and systems in 24 NIID patients with previous surgery. Initial symptoms of NIID and median onset age in different systems also revealed system heterogeneity of NIID.

Interpretation
For the first time, we systematically demonstrated that NIID is a heterogeneous and systemic neurodegenerative disease by providing clinical and pathological evidence. In addition to the nervous system, the clinical symptomatic and pathological spectrum of NIID has been extended to almost all systems.},

	abstract = {Distal myopathies are genetic primary muscle disorders with a prominent weakness at onset in hands and/or feet. The age of onset (from early childhood to adulthood), the distribution of muscle weakness (upper versus lower limbs) and the histological findings (ranging from nonspecific myopathic changes to myofibrillar disarrays and rimmed vacuoles) are extremely variable. However, despite being characterized by a wide clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the distal myopathies are a category of muscular dystrophies: genetic diseases with progressive loss of muscle fibers. Myopathic congenital arthrogryposis is also a form of distal myopathy usually caused by focal amyoplasia., Massive parallel sequencing has further expanded the long list of genes associated with a distal myopathy, and contributed identifying as distal myopathy-causative rare variants in genes more often related with other skeletal or cardiac muscle diseases., Currently, almost 20 genes (ACTN2, CAV3, CRYAB, DNAJB6, DNM2, FLNC, HNRNPA1, HSPB8, KHLH9, LDB3, MATR3, MB, MYOT, PLIN4, TIA1, VCP, NOTCH2NLC, LRP12, GIPS1) have been associated with an autosomal dominant form of distal myopathy. Pathogenic changes in four genes (ADSSL, ANO5, DYSF, GNE) cause an autosomal recessive form; and disease-causing variants in five genes (DES, MYH7, NEB, RYR1 and TTN) result either in a dominant or in a recessive distal myopathy. Finally, a digenic mechanism, underlying a Welander-like form of distal myopathy, has been recently elucidated. Rare pathogenic mutations in SQSTM1, previously identified with a bone disease (Paget disease), unexpectedly cause a distal myopathy when combined with a common polymorphism in TIA1., The present review aims at describing the genetic basis of distal myopathy and at summarizing the clinical features of the different forms described so far.},

Of these, 4 had symptoms of paroxysmal visual field defect, extrapyramidal symptoms, dysautonomia, emotional changes, and cognitive dysfunction. Genetic examination revealed no abnormality related to cerebrovascular diseases. More than 200 CGG repeats of FMR1 gene cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) whereas repeats of the proband were found 29 times, which excluded FXTAS. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and GC-rich-PCR identified an expanded GGC repeat (with ∼100 repeats) in the 5′ region of NOTCH2NLC in the patient and her 2 younger brothers. Pathological examination found eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions inside adipocytes, fibrocytes, and sweat gland cells. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining revealed positive staining for ubiquitin and p62.

The mean confidence intervals were calculated using 1000 bootstraps and are reported as bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap intervals (BCa). No cases or controls had pathogenic repeat sizes. Next, a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was done, and it was found that the two probability distributions did not differ significantly (D = 0.52, P = 0.48), suggesting that they are comparable. Given that the pathogenic expansion frequency was 5–6\% in Chinese essential tremor cases, we expected to find ∼10 samples with a pathogenic expansion (Sun et al., 2020). However, none of the European essential tremor cases or control subjects had a large repeat. The differences may suggest that the pathogenic expansion is rarer in European populations and points towards an ancestry-specific repeat implicated in essential tremor. Furthermore, we failed to find any differences between case-control repeat size distributions, suggesting that both cohorts have similar shape and spread, with no evident positive right shift in case repeat distribution. Future studies could evaluate larger essential tremor cohorts and assess whether the repeat is expanded in essential tremor patients with European ancestry. In conclusion, our results do not support a significant association between NOTCH2NLC 5ʹ UTR expansions and essential tremor risk in European ancestry. Future studies should investigate the role of expansions in essential tremor as typical mutation searches have not had a high yield and anticipation is seen in some families.},

We read their letter with great interest, which describes that abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5′ region of NOTCH2NLC gene is rare in European patients with essential tremor, in contrast to our results in Chinese essential tremor cases. To date, pathogenic GGC repeat expansion of NOTCH2NLC has been found in familial essential tremor patients from mainland China (Chen et al., 2020a; Sun et al., 2020) and sporadic essential tremor cases from Singapore (Ng et al., 2020), but not in the European essential tremor population (Yau et al., 2020a). Intriguingly, this finding is highly consistent with the screening results of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and related disorders, suggesting that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion may be more common in Asian populations (Deng et al., 2019; Ishiura et al., 2019; Okubo et al., 2019; Sone et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b; Fang et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020), especially in Chinese and Japanese; while the pathogenic expansion is rare in the European population (Yau et al., 2020b). This ethnic difference may be related to a genetic founder effect in East Asian populations, as the C9orf72 hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion rates in patients with clinically diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in East Asian populations were much lower than that observed in Caucasian populations (Balendra and Isaacs, 2018).},

Converging evidence verifying the presence of the same GGC repeat expansion in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases has also received increased attention. Inspired by some of the clinical similarities between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA), we used repeat-primed PCR to explore the occurrence of GGC repeats in 328 patients with MSA in mainland China. Our result failed to detect any GGC repeat expansion in these patients with MSA, indicating that the NOTCH2NLC gene may not be involved in the pathogenesis of MSA.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare and slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs. Sporadic NIID case was more frequently encountered than familial. In our study, we reported two adult-onset NIID patients from a family and described their clinical, imaging, and pathological features. The first patient was a 61-year-old man who only presented with non-specific headache and dizziness; however, Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted images (DWI) sequence showed high-intensity signal involving a small regional portion of corticomedullary junction in the frontal and parietal lobe. The older sister of former, a 64-year-old female, who developed sudden onset of weakness of the right limb was admitted to our neurology department. Compared with the first patient, similar DWI high-intensity signal but more extensive area in the corticomedullary junction was found in her brain MRI examination, also prominent leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted image. Significantly, skin pathology of the first patient showed that typical inclusions with strongly positive P62 and ubiquitin antibody could be seen in the nuclei of sweat gland cells, adipocytes, and fibroblasts. FMR1 gene was negative. Although rare, adult-onset NIID should be considered when the characteristic radiology changes of high intensity signal involving the corticomedullary junction in the brain DWI sequence was found. In addition, the pathological result of skin biopsy combined with negative genetic testing FMR1 or NOTCH2NLC can contribute to the accurate diagnosis of the disease. This article aims to improve the radiologists’ knowledge of NIID by our cases presentation and reviewing literature.},

According to published case reports, the common clinical manifestations of NIID include dementia, muscle weakness, autonomic impairment, sensory disturbance, rigidity, ataxia convulsions, etc. However, no cases of oromandibular dystonia were mentioned., Case Presentation: We describe a case of a 58-year-old woman presenting with mouth involuntary chewing initially. She started to show hand tremors, ataxia, and walking instability until 2 years later. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed high intensity signal along the corticomedullary junction. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging showed white matter hyperintensity. Electromyography (EMG) indicated peripheral nerve degeneration. Neuropsychological testing showed memory loss. Finally, skin biopsy and GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) gene confirmed the diagnosis of NIID., Conclusion: This case demonstrated that oromandibular dystonia could be the first symptom of NIID. This case report provides new characteristics of NIID and broadens its clinical spectrum.},

	abstract = {We read the recent paper by Sun et al. (2020) which showed that abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene with a detection rate of 5.58\% was found in a cohort of essential tremor patients from China. Expanded GGC repeats within human-specific NOTCH2NLC was initially identified as the probable pathogenic genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), a rare multisystem neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions existing in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs (Sone et al., 2019). Interestingly, the expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC were also detected in affected individuals with other neurodegenerative phenotypes, like parkinsonism, Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia and multiple system atrophy (Tian et al., 2019; Fang et al., 2020; Jiao et al., 2020). Do abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene cause essential tremor, or is essential tremor a subtype of NIID? Recent studies by Chen et al. (2020) and Ng et al. (2020) proposed that essential tremor is an early symptom of NIID. Another question is whether expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC gene are a common genetic cause of essential tremor pedigrees. However, a recent study from Singapore reported that pathogenic NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were found in patients with sporadic essential tremor (1.4\%), while not in patients with family history (Ng et al., 2020). And the absence of a positive screening result in a European cohort was also noted (Yau et al., 2020). Therefore, to help address these two questions, GGC repeat of NOTCH2NLC gene as well as the image data were both detected in a cohort of 228 essential tremor probands from eastern China.},

In this study, skin biopsy was performed in 10 suspected adult NIID patients with clinical and imaging manifestations, and GGC repeat size in NOTCH2NLC was also screened by repeat primed-PCR and GC-rich PCR. We found that five cases had ubiquitin-immunolabelling intranuclear inclusion bodies by skin biopsy, and all of them were identified with abnormal GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC, among whom four patients showed typical linear hyperintensity at corticomedullary junction on DWI. Five (5/10) NIID patients were diagnosed by combination of NOTCH2NLC gene detection, skin biopsy or combination of NOTCH2NLC, and typical MRI findings. The diagnostic performance of NOTCH2NLC gene detection was highly consistent with that of skin biopsy (Kappa = 1). The unexplained headache was firstly reported as a new early phenotype of NIID. These findings indicate that NOTCH2NLC gene detection is needed to be a supplement in the diagnose flow of NIID and also may be used as an alternative method to skin biopsy especially in Asian population.},

Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5’UTR region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal GGC repeat expansion within the 5’UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {In Reply We appreciate the interest shown by Yau and colleagues for our recent article. They have previously highlighted an absence of abnormal NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions in a sample of White patients with PD.In our study, we identified 3 patients with PD and abnormal GGC repeat expansions and 10 cases with PD and intermediate repeats. Based on these data, we suggest that there may be an association between NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats with patients with sporadic PD. However, we did not suggest any direct causality between GGC repeats and PD. Independent replication is the litmus test for any association studies. Following the publication of our article, Shi et al, in a study of similar size involving 1011 patients with PD and 1134 control participants, identified 11 carriers of PD with intermediate-length repeat expansions but none in the control participants. This independent replication adds weight to the observation that abnormal NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats are present in a very small group of patients with clinically diagnosed PD, although the significance is unclear. In our study, we also drew attention to the interesting observation that none of the patients with PD had GGA interruptions within their GGC expansions, and the frequency of AGC interruptions was much higher than that of patients with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.},

	abstract = {To the Editor In the case-control study by Ma et al, the authors demonstrated an association between patients with sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions; 3 patients had GGC repeat expansions above the pathogenic threshold (\&gt;64 repeats), while 10 patients were in the intermediate range (41-64 repeats). These repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC were recently discovered to cause adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), in which movement disorders are protean manifestations of the disease. However, key questions remains as to whether GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC are a novel monogenetic cause of PD and whether these patients represent a PD phenocopy of NIID. Both NIID and PD have distinctive histopathological features. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease is characterized by widespread eosinophilic neuronal and glial intranuclear inclusions that are positive for antiubiquitin antibody and anti–small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) antibody; the same intranuclear inclusions can be seen in dermal cells. In contrast, the distinguishing pathological feature of PD is dopaminergic, neuromelanin-containing neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by intraneuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies. Three previously reported families with classic PD symptoms and GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC all possessed the hallmark features of NIID in their skin biopsies. Although establishing a causal link between NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion and PD was not an objective of the study by Ma et al, the authors may consider examining their patients’ skin biopsy or postmortem brain tissue, if available, to help answer this clinically relevant question. Furthermore, we performed repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and bioinformatic screening of the GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC in 1208 White patients with PD but did not identify any positive cases. We had previously used a similar method to identify 1 patient with a typical NIID phenotype and inclusions on skin biopsy. Given that all the patients with PD identified in the study by Ma et al were Chinese, we posit that the association between these repeat expansions and PD may vary in different ethnic populations. To ascertain the role of NOTCH2NLC in the pathogenesis of PD, we agree with the authors that further longitudinal clinic-pathological study of patients with PD carrying these repeat expansions would be pertinent.},

This study was intended to investigate whether the GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC is presented in some patients with IPN. A total of 142 unrelated mainland Chinese patients with highly suspected diagnosis of IPN without any known causative gene were recruited. Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) was performed to screen GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC, followed by fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR (AL-PCR) to determine the GGC repeat size. Detailed clinical data as well as nerve, muscle, and skin biopsy were reviewed and analyzed in the NOTCH2NLC-related IPN patients. In total, five of the 142 patients (3.52\%) were found to have pathogenic GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC, with repeat size ranging from 126 to 206 repeats. All the NOTCH2NLC-related IPN patients presented with adult-onset motor–sensory and autonomic neuropathy that predominantly affected the motor component of peripheral nerves. While tremor and irritating dry cough were noted in four-fifths of the patients, no other signs of the central nervous system were presented. Electrophysiological studies revealed both demyelinating and axonal changes of polyneuropathy that were more severe in lower limbs and asymmetrically in upper limbs. Sural nerve pathology was characterized by multiple fibers with thin myelination, indicating a predominant demyelinating process. Muscle pathology was consistent with neuropathic changes. P62-positive intranuclear inclusions were observed in nerve, skin, and muscle tissues. Our study has demonstrated that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with IPN presenting as predominant motor–sensory and autonomic neuropathy, which expands the phenotype of the NOTCH2NLC-related repeat expansion spectrum. Screening of GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC should be considered in patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy with tremor and irritating dry cough.},

Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dementia, tremor, episodic encephalopathy and autonomic nervous dysfunction. To date, vestibular migraine (VM)-like attack has never been reported in cases with NIID. Here, we describe an 86-year-old patient with NIID who presented with recurrent vertigo associated with headache for more than 30 years.

Case presentation
An 86-year-old Chinese woman with vertigo, headache, weakness of limbs, fever, and disturbance of consciousness was admitted to our hospital. She had suffered from recurrent vertigo associated with headache since her 50 s,followed by essential tremor and dementia. On this admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed high intensity signals along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Peripheral neuropathy of the extremities was detected through electrophysiological studies. We diagnosed NIID after detecting eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in the ductal epithelial cells of sweat glands and identifying an abnormal expansion of 81 GGC repeats in the 5’UTR of NOTCH2NLC gene.

Conclusions
VM-like attack may be associated with NIID.},

	abstract = {Background
Both fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and late-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) show CGG/GGC trinucleotide repeat expansions. Differentiating these diseases are difficult because of the similarity in their clinical and radiological features. It is unclear that skin biopsy can distinguish NIID from FXTAS. We performed a skin biopsy in an FXTAS case with cognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy without tremor, which was initially suspected to be NIID.

Case presentation
The patient underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory tests, electrophysiologic test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity lesions along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to middle cerebellar peduncle sign (MCP sign). We suspected NIID from the clinical picture and the radiological findings, and performed a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy specimen showed ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions, suggesting NIID. However, a genetic analysis for NIID using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) revealed no expansion detected in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. We then performed genetic analysis for FXTAS using RP-PCR, which revealed a repeat CGG/GGC expansion in the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. The number of repeats was 83. We finally diagnosed the patient with FXTAS rather than NIID.

Conclusions
For the differential diagnosis of FXTAS and NIID, a skin biopsy alone is insufficient; instead, genetic analysis, is essential. Further investigations in additional cases based on genetic analysis are needed to elucidate the clinical and pathological differences between FXTAS and NIID.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is neurodegenerative disease characterized by widespread inclusions. Despite the identification of GGC repeat expansion in 5’UTR of NOTCH2NLC gene in adult-onset NIIDs, its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. Gain-of-function poly-amino-acid proteins generated by unconventional translation have been revealed in nucleotide repeat expansion disorders, inspiring us to explore the possibility of unconventional translation in NIID. Here we demonstrated that NOTCH2NLC 5’UTR triggers the translation of a polyglycine (polyG)-containing protein, N2NLCpolyG. N2NLCpolyG accumulates in p62-positive inclusions in cultured cells, mouse models, and NIID patient tissues with NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion. Translation of N2NLCpolyG is initiated by an upstream open reading frame (uORF) embedding the GGC repeats. N2NLCpolyG tends to aggregate with the increase of GGC repeat units, and displays phase separation properties. N2NLCpolyG aggregation impairs nuclear lamina and nucleocytoplasmic transport but does not necessarily cause acute death on neuronal cells. Our study suggests a similarity of pathogenic mechanisms between NIID and another GGC-repeat disease, fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome. These findings expand our knowledge of protein gain-of-function in NIID, and further highlight evidence for a novel spectrum of diseases caused by aberrant polyG protein aggregation, namely the polyG diseases.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose The GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been identified as the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Recently, this repeat expansion was also reported to be associated with essential tremor (ET). However, some patients with this repeat expansion, initially diagnosed with ET, were eventually diagnosed with NIID. Therefore, controversy remains regarding the clinical diagnosis of these expansion-positive patients presenting with tremor-dominant symptoms. This study aimed to clarify the clinical phenotype in tremor-dominant patients who have the GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Methods We screened for pathogenic GGC repeat expansions in 602 patients initially diagnosed with ET and systematically re-evaluated the clinical features of the expansion-positive probands and their family members. Results Pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene was detected in 10 probands (1.66\%). Seven of these probands were re-evaluated and found to have systemic areflexia, cognitive impairment, and abnormal nerve conduction, which prompted a change of diagnosis from ET to NIID. Three of the probands had typical hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging. Intranuclear inclusions were detected in all four probands who underwent skin biopsy. Conclusions The NIID tremor-dominant subtype can be easily misdiagnosed as ET. We should take NIID into account for differential diagnosis of ET. Systemic areflexia could be an important clinical clue suggesting that cranial magnetic resonance imaging examination, or even further genetic testing and skin biopsy examination, should be used to confirm the diagnosis of NIID.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with the GGC repeats in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of NOTCH2NLC. NIID exhibits a wide range of clinical manifestations. However, patients presenting with recurrent migraine-like attacks and cerebral edema have only rarely been reported.

Case Presentation
A Chinese female suffered probable migraines with aura for 10 years. At age of 51, aggravating migraine-like attacks co-occurred with a sudden encephalopathy-like episode. Brain MRI showed right cerebral edema and cortical enhancement. Serum lactic acid level was elevated at rest and significantly increased after a simplified serum lactic acid exercise test. The initial diagnosis was MELAS, while NIID was suspected after faint DWI high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction was retrospectively recognized. Mitochondrial genome sequencing and gene panel analysis of nuclear genes related to mitochondrial diseases failed to find any causative variants. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length PCR of NOTCH2NLC gene identified an abnormal expansion of 118 GGC repeats in the 5'UTR of NOTCH2NLC gene.

Conclusion
NIID should be taken into account for differential diagnosis of migraines and MELAS-like episodes. Besides the corticomedullary hyperintensity on DWI, cortical enhancement in contrast-enhanced brain MRI may also be a brain image marker for the differential diagnosis between MELAS and NIID with MELAS-like episodes.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in cells in the central and peripheral nervous system. High-intensity signal in the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is supportive to the diagnosis of NIID. We describe a patient with sporadic adult-onset NIID but without any high-intensity signal on DWI and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).

Case presentation
A 58-year-old woman without special family history developed mild persistent tremor in the right hand and deteriorated 2 years later. At 60 years of age, the patient began to conceive the bank, police and internet being deceptive, further presented apathy and confusion after two and a half years, as well as fabrication of non-existent things. Despite the treatment of antipsychotic drugs due to a diagnosis of mental disorder, the patient appeared weakness in the right limbs. Neurological examination revealed mutism, resting tremor, cogwheel-like rigidity in upper limbs, and weakness in all limbs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging displayed no cerebral atrophy initially but atrophy of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes 5 years later. No any high-intensity signal on DWI and T2WI was revealed. However, hypometabolism in the cortexes with atrophy and the right putamen nucleus were showed on 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance. On the basis of 107 GGC repeats (normal number {\textless}40) in NOTCH2NLC gene and intranuclear inclusions with p62 immunoreactivity in the adipocyte of cutaneous sweat duct by skin biopsy, NIID was finally diagnosed. The symptomatic treatment was given but the patient had no evident improvement.

Conclusions
Our case highlights that despite the lack of high-intensity signal on DWI and T2WI, NIID is still considered for patients with parkinsonism and mental impairment.},

Here, we investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. Methods We screened for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. Results No patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, whereas 16 patients harbored {\textgreater}40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients harboring {\textgreater}60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1\% of patients affected by movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls ({\textless}0.001). The clinical phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44\% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed deposition of intranuclear inclusions.

	abstract = {Background
Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by exclusive degeneration of peripheral motor nerves, while only 20.0–47.8\% of dHMN patients are genetically identified. Recently, GGC expansion in the 5’UTR of NOTCH2NLC has been associated with dHMN. Accordingly, short tandem repeat (STR) should be further explored in genetically unsolved patients with dHMN.

Methods
A total of 128 patients from 90 unrelated families were clinically diagnosed as dHMN, and underwent a comprehensively genetic screening. Skin biopsies were conducted with routine protocols.

Results
Most patients showed chronic distal weakness of lower limbs (121/128), while 20 patients initially had asymmetrical involvements, 14 had subclinical sensory abnormalities, 11 had pyramidal impairments, five had cerebellar disturbance, and four had hyperCKmia. The rate of genetic detection was achieved in 36.7\% (33/90), and the rate increased to 46.7\% (42/90) if patients with variants uncertain significance were included. The most common causative genes included chaperone‐related genes (8/33, 24.2\%), tRNA synthetase genes (4/33, 12.1\%), and cytoskeleton‐related genes (4/33, 12.1\%). Additionally, two dominant inherited families were attributed to abnormal expansion of GGC repeats in the 5‘UTR of NOTCH2NLC; and a patient with dHMN and cerebellar symptoms had CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene. Skin biopsy from patients with GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC revealed typical intranuclear inclusions on histological and ultrastructural examinations.

Interpretations
This study further extends the genetic heterogeneity of dHMN. Given some dHMN patients may be associated with nucleotides repeat expansion, STR screening is necessary to perform in genetically unsolved patients.},

In addition, these inclusions are present in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, visceral organs and skin. In NIID cases with an expansion of GGC repeats in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene, these repeats are located in an upstream open reading frame (uN2C) and result in the production of a polyglycine-containing protein called uN2CpolyG. Typically, patients with adult NIID show high-intensity signals at the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging. We report a case of adult NIID in a 78-year-old Japanese male, who suffered from mild, non-progressive tremor during life but showed no radiographic abnormalities suggestive of adult NIID. Pathologically, ubiquitin-, p62- and uN2CpolyG-positive neuronal intranuclear inclusions were particularly frequent in the hippocampal formation, but were also seen in the enteric plexuses, kidney and cardiac muscles. By contrast, glial intranuclear inclusions were barely evident in the affected regions. The present case also had an immunohistochemical profile differing from that of typical adult NIID.

	abstract = {Background
Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal, and distal limb muscle involvement. Recent research showed that GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene were observed in a proportion of OPDM patients, and these patients were designated as having OPDM type 3 (OPDM3). Heterogeneous neuromuscular manifestations have been described previously in studies of OPDM3; however, kidney involvement in this disease has rarely been reported.

Case presentation
Here, we report the case of a 22-year-old Chinese patient with typical manifestations of OPDM complicated with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). This patient with sporadic FSGS exhibited distal motor neuropathy and rimmed vacuolar myopathy in clinical and pathological examinations. An expansion of 122 CGG repeats located in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene was identified as the causative mutation in this patient. The clinical and histopathological findings fully met the criteria for the diagnosis of OPDM3. In addition, intranuclear inclusions were detected in the renal tubule epithelial cells of this patient, indicating that the kidney may also be impaired in NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders (NREDs).

Conclusions
Our case report demonstrated the clinicopathological cooccurrence of sporadic FSGS and OPDM3 in a patient, which highlighted that the kidney may show inclusion depositions in OPDM3, thus expanding the clinical spectrum of NREDs.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the differential diagnoses of diseases that occur in adulthood and lead to progressive generalized muscle weakness. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a disease in which histopathologically eosinophilic nuclear inclusion bodies are found in various systems. Both familial and sporadic forms of the disease have been reported. Most cases of sporadic NIID are of the dementia type, in which the main symptom is dementia at the first onset. Familial NIID is more diverse, with the main dominant symptoms being muscle weakness (NIID-M), dementia (NIID-D), and parkinsonism (NIID-P). Furthermore, recently, a GGC-repeat expansion in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene, which produces a toxic polyglycine-containing protein (uN2CpolyG) in patients with NIID, has been associated with the pathogenesis of ALS. These results suggest that sporadic NIIDs may have more diverse forms. To date, no autopsy cases of NIID patients with an ALS phenotype have been reported. Here, we describe the first autopsy case report of a patient with sporadic NIID who had been clinically diagnosed with ALS. A 65-year-old Japanese man with no family history of neuromuscular disease developed progressive muscle atrophy and weakness in all limbs. The patient was diagnosed with ALS (El Escoriral diagnostic criteria: probable ALS, laboratory-supported ALS). He had no cognitive dysfunction or neuropathies suggestive of NIID. He required respiratory assistance 48 months after onset. He died of pneumonia at the age of 79 years. Postmortem examinations revealed neuronal loss in the spinal anterior horns and motor cortex. In these affected regions, eosinophilic, round neuronal intranuclear inclusions were evident, which were immunopositive for ubiquitin, p62, and uN2CpolyG. No Bunina bodies or TDP-43-positive inclusions were observed in the brain or spinal cord. Our findings suggest that a small proportion of patients with NIID can manifest a clinical phenotype of ALS. Although skin biopsy is commonly used for the clinical diagnosis of NIID, it may also be useful to identify cases of NIID masquerading as ALS.},

The aim of this study was to identify the genetic basis of patients with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). We collected 79 unrelated DNA samples clinically suspected with HSAN from multiple regions of Japan. Mutation screening was first performed using gene panel sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified from genes of WNK1/HSN2 (6 cases), SCN9A (3 cases), NTRK1 (3 cases), and DNMT1 (2 cases). Subsequently, long-range flanking PCR and repeat-primed PCR were applied to analyze repeat expansions in RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC. Bi-allelic RFC1 repeat expansions were detected from 20 adult-onset HSAN patients, consisting of [(AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (8 cases), [(ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (8 cases), and [(AAGGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (4 cases). GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was found in 1 case. Single-nucleotide variant-based haplotype analysis of patients harboring disease-associated repeat expansions in RFC1 revealed distinguishable haplotypes among subgroups with different repeat genotypes. These findings substantially redefine the genetic spectrum of HSAN, where multi-type RFC1 repeat expansions account for 25.3\% of all patients, highlighting the necessity of genetic screening, particularly for adult-onset patients.},

	abstract = {Objective
The diagnosis of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is currently based on CGG repeat expansion in the 5′UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene, or p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy. The purpose of this study is to explore the value of non-invasive pathological findings in urine sediment cells from NIID patients.

Materials and methods
Ten patients with clinically suspected NIID were enrolled for skin biopsy and gene screening. Morning urine (500 ml) was collected from each patient, and cell sediment was obtained by centrifugation. Urine cytology, including Giemsa staining, p62 immunostaining, and electron microscopic examination, were conducted on cell sediment.

Results
The main clinical symptoms of 10 patients included episodic disturbance of consciousness, cognitive impairment, tremor, limb weakness, and so on. Cerebral MRI showed that 9 patients had linear DWI high signal in the corticomedullary junction. Genetic testing found that the number of CGG repeat ranged from 96 to 158 in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Skin biopsy revealed that all patients showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in 18.5 ± 6.3\% of the duct epithelial cells of sweat gland. In contrast, urine sediment smears revealed that only 3 patients had p62 positive intranuclear inclusions in 3.5 ± 1.2\% of the sedimentary cells. Ultrastructural examinations showed that intranuclear inclusions were also identified in the cell sediment of the 3 patients.

Conclusion
Urine cytology may be a new and non-invasive pathological diagnosis technique for some NIID patients, although the positive rate is not as high as that of skin biopsy, which is a sensitive and reliable pathological method for NIID.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), caused by an expansion of GGC repeats in the 5′-untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC, is an important but underdiagnosed cause of adult-onset leukoencephalopathies. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence, clinical spectrum and brain MRI characteristics of NIID in adult-onset nonvascular leukoencephalopathies and assess the diagnostic performance of neuroimaging features.One hundred and sixty-one unrelated Taiwanese patients with genetically undetermined nonvascular leukoencephalopathies were screened for the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions using fragment analysis, repeat-primed PCR, Southern blot analysis and/or nanopore sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment. Among them, 32 (19.9\%) patients had an expanded NOTCH2NLC allele and were diagnosed with NIID. We enrolled another two affected family members from one patient for further analysis. The size of the expanded NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats in the 34 patients ranged from 73 to 323 repeats. Skin biopsies from five patients all showed eosinophilic, p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells and dermal adipocytes.Among the 34 NIID patients presenting with nonvascular leukoencephalopathies, the median age at symptom onset was 61 years (range, 41–78 years) and the initial presentations included cognitive decline (44.1\%; 15/34), acute encephalitis-like episodes (32.4\%; 11/34), limb weakness (11.8\%; 4/34) and parkinsonism (11.8\%; 4/34). Cognitive decline (64.7\%; 22/34) and acute encephalitis-like episodes (55.9\%; 19/34) were also the most common overall manifestations. Two-thirds of the patients had either bladder dysfunction or visual disturbance. Comparing the brain MRI features between the NIID patients and individuals with other undetermined leukoencephalopathies, corticomedullary junction curvilinear lesions on diffusion weighted images were the best biomarkers for diagnosing NIID with high specificity (98.4\%) and sensitivity (88.2\%). However, this diffusion weighted imaging abnormality was absent in 11.8\% of the NIID patients. When only fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were available, the presence of white matter hyperintensity lesions either in the paravermis or middle cerebellar peduncles also favoured the diagnosis of NIID with a specificity of 85.3\% and sensitivity of 76.5\%. Among the MRI scans of 10 patients, performed within 5 days of the onset of acute encephalitis-like episodes, five showed cortical hyperintense lesions on diffusion weighted images and two revealed focal brain oedema.In conclusion, NIID accounts for 19.9\% (32/161) of patients with adult-onset genetically undiagnosed nonvascular leukoencephalopathies in Taiwan. Half of the NIID patients developed encephalitis-like episodes with restricted diffusion in the cortical regions on diffusion weighted images at the acute stage. Corticomedullary junction hyperintense lesions, white matter hyperintensities in the paravermis or middle cerebellar peduncles, bladder dysfunction and visual disturbance are useful hints to diagnosing NIID.},

Here, we developed a fly model of CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC, recapitulated key pathological and clinical features of NIID, and characterized the mitochondrial dysfunction in these model organisms, human samples, and cellular models. Moreover, idebenone treatment restored mitochondrial function and alleviated neurodegenerative phenotypes in transgenic flies., Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neuromuscular/neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene. These repeats can be translated into a polyglycine-containing protein, uN2CpolyG, which forms protein inclusions and is toxic in cell models, albeit through an unknown mechanism. Here, we established a transgenic Drosophila model expressing uN2CpolyG in multiple systems, which resulted in progressive neuronal cell loss, locomotor deficiency, and shortened lifespan. Interestingly, electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial swelling both in transgenic flies and in muscle biopsies of individuals with NIID. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed colocalization of uN2CpolyG with mitochondria in cell and patient samples, while biochemical analysis revealed that uN2CpolyG interacted with a mitochondrial RNA binding protein, LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing protein). Furthermore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and functional assays showed down-regulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in uN2CpolyG-expressing flies and NIID muscle biopsies. Finally, idebenone treatment restored mitochondrial function and alleviated neurodegenerative phenotypes in transgenic flies. Overall, these results indicate that transgenic flies expressing uN2CpolyG recapitulate key features of NIID and that reversing mitochondrial dysfunction might provide a potential therapeutic approach for this disorder.},

Owing to its widely varying clinical manifestations, NIID is frequently misdiagnosed or overlooked. However, a characteristic high-intensity corticomedullary junction signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is often indicative of NIID. In this study, we described the case of two sisters with NIID who presented with distinct symptoms and imaging data. The younger sister showed symptoms similar to those of mitochondrial encephalopathy, with a reversible high-intensity signal from the cortex on T2 and DWI. The elder sister showed a characteristic high-signal “ribbon sign” in the corticomedullary junction on DWI. Skin biopsy confirmed that both had neuronal intranuclear inclusion. Two years later, the younger sister also developed the characteristic high-signal “ribbon sign” in the corticomedullary junction on DWI.

Over the past decade, the discoveries of three new muscle disease genes have added a new dimension to the relationship between the Notch signaling pathway and skeletal muscle: MEGF10, POGLUT1, and JAG2. We review the clinical syndromes associated with pathogenic variants in each of these genes, known molecular and cellular functions of their protein products with a particular focus on the Notch signaling pathway, and potential novel therapeutic targets that may emerge from further investigations of these diseases. The phenotypes associated with two of these genes, POGLUT1 and JAG2, clearly fall within the realm of muscular dystrophy, whereas the third, MEGF10, is associated with a congenital myopathy/muscular dystrophy overlap syndrome classically known as early‐onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia. JAG2 is a canonical Notch ligand, POGLUT1 glycosylates the extracellular domain of Notch receptors, and MEGF10 interacts with the intracellular domain of NOTCH1. Additional genes and their encoded proteins relevant to muscle function and disease with links to the Notch signaling pathway include TRIM32, ATP2A1 (SERCA1), JAG1, PAX7, and NOTCH2NLC.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurological degenerative disorder with diverse manifestations and inadequate awareness. Only a few cases of NIID have been reported, and typical imaging findings can provide certain clues for the diagnosis of the disease. Furthermore, skin biopsy and genetic testing are important to confirm the diagnosis.

CASE SUMMARY
An 84-year-old man presented to the Neurology Department of our hospital complaining of a progressive course of cognitive impairment and unsteady gait for 2 years. The symptoms gradually progressed and affected his daily life. The patient was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and vascular dementia. The patient did not respond to conventional treatment, such as dopasehydrazine. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Based on the imaging findings, we suspected an NIID diagnosis. During the 3-year follow-up in our hospital, his clinical symptoms gradually progressed, and imaging findings became more significant. A high signal intensity along the corticomedullary junction persisted on MRI. Gene testing and skin biopsy were recommended in our hospital; however, the patient refused these procedures. NIID was also considered when he went to a superior hospital in Shanghai. The patient eventually agreed to undergo gene testing. This revealed abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene.

CONCLUSION
The clinical manifestations of NIID are diverse. Patients with clinical manifestations similar to Parkinson’s disease and dementia may have NIID.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions have been identified to be associated with essential tremor (ET). Our aim was to characterize ET patients with NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions versus non-expansions and describe distinctive clinical features of repeat expanded patients with long-term follow-up according to the new tremor classification. Methods Participants included 597 ET pedigrees, 412 sporadic cases and 1085 healthy controls. Repeat expansions of GGC in NOTCH2NLC were screened, and comprehensive clinical features were investigated. A longitudinal clinical assessment and reclassification were performed in NOTCH2NLC expanded patients. Results In total, 27 ET pedigrees (27/597) and three sporadic patients (3/412) were identified with pathogenic NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions (≥60 repeats). Intermediate-length GGC repeats (41–59 repeats) were found in four sporadic ET cases and one control subject, and the frequency was higher than that in control participants (4/412 vs. 1/1085, p = 0.022). About 46 ET patients (43 familial cases from 27 pedigrees and three sporadic cases) with NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions had higher Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale I, Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale II and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale scores and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than the patients without expansions. Patients with pathogenic GGC repeats were reclassified as pure ET (25/46), ET-plus (11/46) and ET-neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (10/46) subgroups at 2–8 years of follow-up. Conclusion Our results further supported that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were associated with ET. Patients with pathogenic GGC repeats presented with more severe motor and non-motor symptoms. Further long-term follow-up and subtype studies will help to define the role of NOTCH2NLC in ET.},

There are several genes have been found to relate to AD, including the human-specific Notch2 N terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. The CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC has been reported in clinically diagnosed AD patients. However, it has not been reported in pathologically confirmed AD cases. In this study, we detected the NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion in pathologically confirmed AD brain samples by repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR). As a result, the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was validated in one out of 39 pathologically confirmed AD cases. Pathologically, p62 positive intranuclear inclusions were observed in wide brain areas, and most inclusions appeared to be presented in the glial cells. In summary, our study found that the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with pathologically confirmed AD. The p62-positive intranuclear inclusions could co-exist with AD neuropathologic changes. These data suggest that the association of NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion with AD may be stronger than in previous studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease, with complex and diverse clinical manifestations and pathological eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral nervous systems and visceral organs. Improvements in diagnostic methods such as skin biopsy and gene testing are helpful in revealing the clinical and genetic characters of NIID.

Materials and methods
We presented two cases of NIID diagnosed by using NOTCH2NLC gene testing and skin biopsy. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed high linear intensity in corticomedullary junction. We also reviewed all the published NIID cases with positive NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion and skin biopsy results in PubMed.

Results
Patient 1 was a 63-year-old male who carried 148 GGC repeats and presented with progressive tremor and limb weakness. Patient 2 was a 62-year-old woman who carried 131 GGC repeats and presented with tremors, memory loss and headaches. The most common clinical manifestation of 63 NIID patients in this study was cognitive impairment, followed by tremors. In our study, almost all the patients were from East Asia, the male to female ratio was 1:1.26, with an age of onset of 54.12 ± 14.12 years, and an age of diagnosis of 60.03 ± 12.21 years. Symmetrical high signal intensity at the corticomedullary junction on DWI were revealed in 80.96\% of the patients. For the GGC repeat numbers, the majority of GGC repeats were in the 80–119 intervals, with few GGC repeats above 160. The number of GGC repetitions was significantly higher in patients presented with muscle weakness than in other clinical manifestations.

Conclusion
NIID is a neurodegenerative disease caused by aberrant polyglycine (polyG) protein aggregation. NIID mostly occurs in the elderly population in East Asia, with cognitive dysfunction as the most common symptom. Staging NIID based on clinical presentation is inappropriate because most patients with NIID have overlapping symptoms. In our study, there was no significant correlation between the number of GGC repeats and different phenotypes except for muscle weakness. Abnormal trinucleotides repeat and PolyG protein aggregation maybe common pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, which needs to be confirmed by more studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), which pathogenesis remains largely unclear, is a neurodegenerative disease caused by GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC gene. As case studies have reported dynamic cortical perfusion changes in NIID, this study aimed to explore the cerebral perfusion pattern in NIID patients.

Materials and methods
A total of 38 NIID patients and 34 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, and 2 NIID patients who had had episodic symptoms within 2 months were excluded. Data on demographic characteristics and clinical features were collected. All participants underwent three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Voxel-based comparisons of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were conducted.

Results
NIID patients showed decreased perfusion in the cortex but increased perfusion in the deep brain regions compared with HCs. The regions with significant hypoperfusion were distributed in the bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital gyri, with the left frontal gyrus being the most prominent. The regions with significant hyperperfusion included the bilateral basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, para-hippocampal, and parts of the bilateral cerebellum, fusiform, lingual, rectus, orbital, and cingulum anterior gyri, which were adjacent to the midline (all FDR-corrected p {\textless}0.05). When comparing the mean CBF value of the whole brain, no significant differences were observed between NIID patients and HCs (28.81 ± 10.1 vs. 27.99 ± 5.68 ml/100 g*min, p = 0.666). Voxel-based analysis showed no significant difference in cerebral perfusion between NIID patients with and without episodic symptoms. The perfusion within the bilateral middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyri showed positive correlations with MMSE and MoCA scores using age, sex, and education as covariates (p {\textless}0.005 uncorrected).

Conclusion
NIID patients exhibited characteristic cortical hypoperfusion and deep brain hyperperfusion. The perfusion in the bilateral frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus was correlated with the severity of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebral perfusion change may be involved in NIID pathophysiology and serve as a potential indicator for monitoring NIID severity and progression.},

Previous studies indicated that the high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on brain MRI, known as the “ribbon sign,” could serve as a strong diagnostic clue. Here we used the explorative approach to study the undiagnosed rate of adult-onset NIID in a single center in China via searching for the ribbon sign in picture archive and communication system (PACS) and report the clinical and radiological features of initially undiagnosed NIID patients., Consecutive brain MRI of 21,563 adult individuals (≥18 years) in the PACS database in 2019 from a tertiary hospital were reviewed. Of them, 4,130 were screened out using the keywords “leukoencephalopathy” and “white matter demyelination.” Next, all 4,130 images were read by four neurologists. The images with the suspected ribbon sign were reanalyzed by two neuroradiologists. Those with the ribbon sign but without previously diagnosed NIID were invited for skin biopsy and/or genetic testing for diagnostic confirmation. The clinical features of all NIID patients were retrospectively reviewed., Five patients with high-intensity in the corticomedullary junction on DWI were enrolled. Three patients were previously diagnosed with NIID confirmed by genetic or pathological findings and presented with episodic encephalopathy or cognitive impairment. The other two patients were initially diagnosed with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with rimmed vacuoles (RVs) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in one each. Genetic analysis demonstrated GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene of both, and skin biopsy of the first patient showed the presence of intranuclear hyaline inclusion bodies. Thus, five of the 21,563 adult patients (≥18 years) were diagnosed with NIID. The distinctive subcortical high-intensity signal on DWI was distributed extensively throughout the lobes, corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brainstem. In addition, T2-weighted imaging revealed white matter hyperintensity of Fazekas grade 2 or 3, atrophy, and ventricular dilation. Distinctive DWI hyperintensity in the junction between the gray and white matter can help identify atypical NIID cases. Our findings highly suggest that neurologists and radiologists should recognize the characteristic neuroimaging pattern of NIID.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in neuronal and other somatic cells. Skin biopsies are reportedly useful in diagnosing NIID, and the genetic cause of NIID was identified as a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC in recent years. The number of adult patients diagnosed via genetic testing has increased; however, there have been no detailed reports of pediatric NIID cases with GGC expansions in NOTCH2NLC. This is the first detailed report of a pediatric patient showing various neurological symptoms from the age of 10 and was ultimately diagnosed with NIID via skin biopsy and triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction analyses.
Case report
This was an 18-year-old female who developed cyclic vomiting, distal dominant muscle weakness, and sustained miosis at 10 years. Nerve conduction studies revealed axonal degeneration, and her neuropathy had slowly progressed despite several rounds of high-dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. At 13 years, she had an acute encephalopathy-like episode. At 15 years, brain MRI revealed slightly high-intensity lesions on diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted imaging in the subcortical white matter of her frontal lobes that expanded over time. At 16 years, esophagography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and esophageal manometry revealed esophageal achalasia, and per-oral endoscopic myotomy was performed. At 18 years, we diagnosed her with NIID based on the findings of skin specimen analyses and a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC.
Conclusion
NIID should be considered as a differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with various neurological symptoms.},

To determine whether there is a medium-length amplification of NOTCH2NLC in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we screened 476 ALS patients and 210 healthy controls for the presence of a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC by using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) and fragment analysis. The repeat number in ALS patients was 16.11 ± 5.7 (range 7–46), whereas the repeat number in control subjects was 16.19 ± 3.79 (range 10–29). An intermediate-length GGC repeat expansion was observed in two ALS patients (numbers of repeats: 45, 46; normal repeat number ≤ 40) but not in the control group.

	abstract = {Background and purpose Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is associated with CGG repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Although pure or dominant peripheral neuropathy has been described as a subtype of NIID in a few patients, most NIID patients predominantly show involvements of the central nervous system (CNS). It is necessary to further explore whether these patients have subclinical peripheral neuropathy. Methods Twenty-eight NIID patients, clinically characterized by CNS-dominant involvements, were recruited from two tertiary hospitals. Standard nerve conduction studies were performed in all patients. Skin and sural nerve biopsies were performed in 28 and 15 patients, respectively. Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to screen the CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. Results All 28 patients can be diagnosed with NIID based on skin pathological and genetic changes. All patients predominantly showed CNS symptoms mainly characterized by episodic encephalopathy and cognitive impairments, but no clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy could be observed initially. Electrophysiological abnormalities were found in 96.4\% (27/28) of these patients, indicating that subclinical peripheral neuropathy is common in NIID patients with CNS-dominant type. Electrophysiological and neuropathological studies revealed that demyelinating degeneration was the main pathological pattern in these patients, although mild axonal degeneration was also observed in some patients. No significant association between CGG repeat size and the change of nerve conduction velocity was found in these patients. Conclusions This study demonstrated that most patients with CNS-dominant NIID had subclinical peripheral neuropathy. Electrophysiological examination should be the routinely diagnostic workflow for every NIID patient.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the neurons, glial cells, and other somatic cells. Although CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC have been identified in most East Asian patients with NIID, the pathophysiology of NIID remains unclear. Ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions are the pathological hallmark of NIID. Targeted immunostaining studies have identified several other proteins present in these inclusions. However, the global molecular changes within nuclei with these inclusions remained unclear. Herein, we analyzed the proteomic profile of nuclei with p62-positive inclusions in a NIID patient with CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC to discover candidate proteins involved in the NIID pathophysiology. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify each protein identified in the nuclei with p62-positive inclusions. The distribution of increased proteins was confirmed via immunofluorescence in autopsy brain samples from three patients with genetically confirmed NIID. Overall, 526 proteins were identified, of which 243 were consistently quantified using MS. A 1.4-fold increase was consistently observed for 20 proteins in nuclei with p62-positive inclusions compared to those without. Fifteen proteins identified with medium or high confidence in the LC-MS/MS analysis were further evaluated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed enrichment of several terms, including poly(A) RNA binding, nucleosomal DNA binding, and protein binding. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the fluorescent intensities of increased RNA-binding proteins identified by proteomic analysis, namely hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP A3, and hnRNP C1/C2, were higher in the nuclei with p62-positive inclusions than in those without, which were not confined to the intranuclear inclusions. We identified several increased proteins in nuclei with p62-positive inclusions. Although larger studies are needed to validate our results, these proteomic data may form the basis for understanding the pathophysiology of NIID.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions and the GGC repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC. The prevalent presence of high-intensity signal along the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) helps to recognize this heterogeneous disease despite of highly variable clinical manifestations. However, patients without the typical sign on DWI are often misdiagnosed. Besides, there are no reports of NIID patients presenting with paroxysmal peripheral neuropathy-like onset to date.

Case presentation
We present a patient with NIID who suffered recurrent transient numbness in arms for 17 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse, bilateral white matter lesions without typical subcortical DWI signals. Electrophysiological studies revealed mixed demyelinating and axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathies involving four extremities. After excluding differential diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy through body fluid tests and a sural nerve biopsy, NIID was confirmed by a skin biopsy and the genetic analysis of NOTCH2NLC.

Conclusion
This case innovatively demonstrates that NIID could manifest as paroxysmal peripheral neuropathy-like onset, and addresses the electrophysiological characteristics of NIID in depth. We broaden the clinical spectrum of NIID and provide new insights into its differential diagnosis from the perspective of peripheral neuropathy.},

This finding was not confirmed in an ALS cohort of subjects from Taiwan. As the involvement of expanded NOTCH2NLC alleles in ALS is debated, we addressed this point by evaluating NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions in an Italian cohort of ALS patients. A screening analysis of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats was performed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) in a cohort of 385 probable/definite ALS Italian patients. Mean age at onset was 60.5 years (SD 13.7), and 60.9\% were males. Sporadic cases were 357 (92.7\%), and most patients had a spinal onset (71.8\%). None of our patients showed the typical sawtooth tail pattern on RP-PCR, thus excluding abnormal repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. Overall, we suggest that NOTCH2NLC expanded alleles might be absent or at least extremely rare in ALS Italian patients. Further investigations in larger cohorts with different ethnic backgrounds are required to support the involvement of NOTCH2NLC in ALS.},

	abstract = {Objective
GGC repeat expansions in the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene have been reported as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Given the clinical overlap of cognitive impairment in NIID and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), both diseases have white matter hyperintensity on T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences of brain MRI, and white matter hyperintensity is a primary neuroimaging marker of CSVD on MRI. Therefore, we hypothesised that the GGC repeat expansions might also contribute to CSVD. To further investigate the relationship between NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions and CSVD, we performed a genetic analysis of 814 patients with the disease.

Methods
We performed a comprehensive GGC repeat expansion screening in NOTCH2NLC from 814 patients with sporadic CSVD. Their Fazekas score was greater than or equal to 3 points. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length analyses were performed to identify GGC repeat expansions, and whole-exome sequencing was used to detect any pathogenic mutation in previously reported genes associated with CSVD.

Results
We identified nine (1.11\%) patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansions ranging from 41 to 98 repeats. The minor allele frequency of expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC was 0.55\%.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest that intermediate-length and longer-length GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC are associated with sporadic CSVD. This provides new thinking for studying the pathogenesis of CSVD.},

	abstract = {Background:Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), caused by GGC (guanine-guanine-cytosine) repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC, has several clinical and radiological features akin to cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). The present study tested the hypothesis that NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion may contribute to cSVD.Methods:One hundred and ninety-seven unrelated patients with genetically unsolved vascular leukoencephalopathy without NOTCH3, HTRA1, and mitochondrial m.3243A{\textgreater}G mutations and 730 healthy individuals were screened for NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, fragment analysis, Southern blot analysis, or nanopore sequencing with Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9)-mediated enrichment. The clinical and neuroimaging features of the patients were compared between individuals with and without NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion.Results:Six of the 197 (3.0\%) patients with unsolved vascular leukoencephalopathy and none of the controls carried the GGC repeat expansion (P=0.00009). Skin biopsy of 1 patient revealed eosinophilic, ubiquitin-positive, and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the cells of sweat gland and capillary, providing pathologic evidence for the involvement of small vessels in NIID. For the 6 patients, gait disturbance and cognitive decline were common manifestations with a median onset age of 65 (59–69) years. They all had multiple neuroimaging features suggestive of cSVD, including diffuse white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and enlarged perivascular space in all 6 patients, cerebral microbleeds in 5, and old intracerebral hemorrhage in 4. Four patients had linear hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging—the characteristic neuroimaging feature of NIID. There was no difference in the severity of cSVD imaging features between the patients with and without the GGC expansion but more pronounced brain atrophy in the patients with the GGC expansion.Conclusions:NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion accounted for 3\% of genetically unsolved Taiwanese vascular leukoencephalopathy cases after excluding participants with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL), and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). NIID should be considered in patients manifesting cSVD, especially in those with characteristic neuroimaging feature of NIID.},

Two patients were legally blind and had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa prior to the diagnosis of NIID and assessed with whole exome sequencing to rule out comorbidity with other retinal diseases. Fundus photographs around the posterior pole showed chorioretinal atrophy in the peripapillary regions. OCT showed thinning of the retina. ERGs showed various abnormalities in cases. The histopathology of autopsy samples showed diffusely scattered intranuclear inclusions throughout the retina from the retinal pigment epithelium to the ganglion cell layer, and optic nerve glial cells. And severe gliosis was observed in retina and optic nerve. The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion causes numerous intranuclear inclusions in the retina and optic nerve cells and gliosis. Visual dysfunction could be the first sign of NIID. We should consider NIID as one of the causes of retinal dystrophy and investigate the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC.},

Expansions of intronic GGC trinucleotide repeats in the NOTCH2 N-terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene cause NIID. In this study, to clarify the clinical characteristics useful for the differential diagnosis of NIID, clinical data of neurological examination, neuroimaging, and nerve conduction studies of six NIID patients diagnosed by pathological or genetic investigations were analyzed. Clinically useful characteristics for diagnosing NIID include general hyporeflexia, episodic disturbance of consciousness, sensory disturbance, miosis, and dementia. Furthermore, neuroimaging findings, such as leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and a linear high intensity of subcortical U-fibers in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as decreased motor nerve conduction velocity, are especially important biomarkers for NIID. However, it is necessary to remember that these features may not always be present, as shown in one of the cases who did not have a DWI abnormality in this study. This study also investigated whether expanded GGC repeats were translated into polyglycine. Immunohistochemical analysis using a custom antibody raised against putative C-terminal polypeptides followed by polyglycine of uN2CpolyG revealed that polyglycines were localized in the intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy specimens from all six patients, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis of NIID.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that can affect the nervous and other systems of the body. Its clinical manifestations are complex and easily misdiagnosed. Adult-onset NIID beginning with autonomic symptoms such as recurrent hypotension, profuse sweating, and syncope has not been reported.

Case presentation
An 81-year-old male was admitted to the hospital in June 2018 due to repeated episodes of hypotension, profuse sweating, pale complexion, and syncope for 3 years, and progressive dementia for 2 years. DWI was not possible due to the presence of metal residues in the body. Cutaneous histopathology revealed sweat gland cell nuclear inclusions and immunohistochemistry showed p62 nuclear immunoreactivity. Blood RP-PCR identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5′UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene. Accordingly, this case was diagnosed as adult-onset NIID in August 2018. The patient subsequently received vitamin C nutritional support, rehydration, and other vital signs maintenance treatments during hospitalization, but the above symptoms still recurred after discharge. With the development of the disease, lower extremity weakness, slow movement, dementia, repeated constipation, and vomiting appeared successively. In April 2019, he was hospitalized again for severe pneumonia, and died of multiple organ failure in June 2019.

Conclusion
The presented case exemplifies great clinical heterogeneity of NIID. Some patients may have neurological symptoms and other systemic symptoms simultaneously. This patient started with autonomic symptoms, including recurrent episodes of hypotension, profuse sweating, pallor, and syncope, which progressed rapidly. This case report provides new information for the diagnosis of NIID.},

Distinct from the relatively more abundant studies of gLEs in children, only a few studies that explore the spectrum of adult gLEs have been published, and it should be noted that the majority of these excluded certain gLEs. Thus, to date, no large study has been designed and conducted to characterize the genetic and phenotypic spectra of gLEs in adult patients., We recruited a consecutive series of 309 adult patients clinically suspected of gLEs from Beijing Tiantan Hospital between January 2014 and December 2021. Whole-exome sequencing, mitochondrial DNA sequencing and repeat analysis of NOTCH2NLC, FMR1, DMPK and ZNF9 were performed for patients. We describe the genetic and phenotypic spectra of the set of patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis and summarize their clinical and radiological characteristics., A total of 201 patients (65\%) were genetically diagnosed, while 108 patients (35\%) remained undiagnosed. The most frequent diseases were leukoencephalopathies related to NOTCH3 (25\%), NOTCH2NLC (19\%), ABCD1 (9\%), CSF1R (7\%) and HTRA1 (5\%). Based on a previously proposed pathological classification, the gLEs in our cohort were divided into leukovasculopathies (35\%), leuko-axonopathies (31\%), myelin disorders (21\%), microgliopathies (7\%) and astrocytopathies (6\%). Patients with NOTCH3 mutations accounted for 70\% of the leukovasculopathies, followed by HTRA1 (13\%) and COL4A1/2 (9\%). The leuko-axonopathies contained the richest variety of associated genes, of which NOTCH2NLC comprised 62\%. Among myelin disorders, demyelinating leukoencephalopathies (61\%)—mainly adrenoleukodystrophy and Krabbe disease—accounted for the majority, while hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies (2\%) were rare. CSF1R was the only mutated gene detected in microgliopathy patients. Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter disease due to mutations in EIF2B2-5 accounted for half of the astrocytopathies., We characterized the genetic and phenotypic spectra of adult gLEs in a large Chinese cohort. The most frequently mutated genes were NOTCH3, NOTCH2NLC, ABCD1, CSF1R and HTRA1., Wu et al. describe the clinical and radiological features of genetic leukoencephalopathies in a large cohort of 309 adults, and find that the most frequently mutated genes are NOTCH3 (25\%), NOTCH2NLC (19\%), ABCD1 (9\%), CSF1R (7\%) and HTRA1 (5\%).},

	abstract = {Background
This study aimed to investigate the features of autonomic dysfunction (AutD) in a large cohort of patients with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID).

Methods
A total of 122 patients with NIID and 122 controls were enrolled. All participants completed the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson’s Disease-Autonomic Questionnaire (SCOPA-AUT) and genetic screening for GGC expanded repeats within the NOTCH2NLC gene. All patients underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessments. SCOPA-AUT was performed to compare AutD between patients and controls. The associations between AutD and disease-related characteristics of NIID were studied.

Results
94.26\% of patients had AutD. Compared with controls, patients had more severe AutD in total SCOPA-AUT, gastrointestinal, urinary, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, pupillomotor and sexual domains (all p {\textless} 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) value for the total SCOPA-AUT (AUC = 0.846, sensitivity = 69.7\%, specificity = 85.2\%, cutoff value = 4.5) was high in differentiating AtuD of patients with NIID from controls. The total SCOPA-AUT was significantly and positively associated with age (r = 0.185, p = 0.041), disease duration (r = 0.207, p = 0.022), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (r = 0.446, p {\textless} 0.01), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (r = 0.390, p {\textless} 0.01). Patients with onset-of-AutD had higher SCOPA-AUT scores than patients without onset-of-AutD (p {\textless} 0.001), especially in the urinary system (p {\textless} 0.001) and male sexual dysfunction (p {\textless} 0.05).

Conclusion
SCOPA-AUT can be used as a diagnostic and quantitative tool for autonomic dysfunction in NIID. The high prevalence of AutD in patients suggests that NIID diagnosis should be considered in patients with AutD, especially in those with unexplained AutD alone. AutD in patients is related to age, disease duration, impairment of daily living ability, and psychiatric symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background
High signals on diffusion weighted imaging along the corticomedullary junction (CMJ) have demonstrated excellent diagnostic values for adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). However, the longitudinal course of diffusion weighted imaging high intensities in adult-onset NIID patients has rarely been investigated.

Methods
We described four NIID cases that had been discovered using skin biopsy and NOTCH2NLC gene testing, after diffusion weighted imaging exhibiting the distinctive corticomedullary junction high signals. Then using complete MRI data from NIID patients, we analyzed the chronological diffusion weighted imaging alterations of those individuals that had been published in Pub Med.

Results
We discussed 135 NIID cases with comprehensive MRI data, including our four cases, of whom 39 had follow-up outcomes. The following are the four primary diffusion weighted imaging dynamic change patterns: (1) high signal intensities in the corticomedullary junction were negative on diffusion weighted imaging even after an 11-year follow-up (7/39); (2) diffusion weighted imagings were initially negative but subsequently revealed typical findings (9/39); (3) high signal intensities vanished during follow-up (3/39); (4) diffusion weighted imagings were positive at first and developed in a step-by-step manner (20/39). We discovered that NIID lesions eventually damaged the deep white matter, which comprises the cerebral peduncles, brain stem, middle cerebellar peduncles, paravermal regions, and cerebellar white matter.

Conclusion
The longitudinal dynamic changes in NIID of diffusion weighted imaging are highly complex. We find that there are four main patterns of dynamic changes on diffusion weighted imaging. Furthermore, as the disease progressed, NIID lesions eventually involved the deep white matter.},

We collected clinical information including age, sex, skin biopsy site, the presence of nuclear inclusion bodies, the results of p62 immunostaining, the final diagnosis from the department of neurology, and the presence of abnormal GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Four of the 12 cases had a final diagnosis of NIID. One of the four cases was biopsied from the lower leg, whereas the other three cases were biopsied from the abdomen or thigh. Biopsy specimens of the four definite NIID cases revealed the average rates of nuclear inclusion body-positive cells in adipocytes, sweat gland cells, and fibroblasts to be 13.2\%, 10.3\%, and 6.3\%, respectively. GGC repeat abnormalities in the NOTCH2NLC gene were observed in two of the four cases.

	abstract = {GGC repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of NOTCH2NLC is associated with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders, especially neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Studies have found that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC induces the formation of polyglycine (polyG)-containing protein, which is involved in the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions. However, the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats is unclear. Here, we used NIID patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids (3DCOs) and cellular models to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion. IPSC-derived 3DCOs and cellular models showed the deposition of polyG-containing intranuclear inclusions. The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats could induce the upregulation of autophagic flux, enhance integrated stress response and activate EIF2α phosphorylation. Bulk RNA sequencing for iPSC-derived neurons and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for iPSC-derived 3DCOs revealed that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats may be associated with dysfunctions in ribosome biogenesis and translation. Moreover, NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats could induce the NPM1 nucleoplasm translocation, increase nucleolar stress, impair ribosome biogenesis and induce ribosomal RNA sequestration, suggesting dysfunction of membraneless organelles in the NIID cellular model. Dysfunctions in ribosome biogenesis and phosphorylated EIF2α and the resulting increase in the formation of G3BP1-positive stress granules may together lead to whole-cell translational inhibition, which may eventually cause cell death. Interestingly, scRNA-seq revealed that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats may be associated with a significantly decreased proportion of immature neurons while 3DCOs were developing. Together, our results underscore the value of patient-specific iPSC-derived 3DCOs in investigating the mechanisms of polyG diseases, especially those caused by repeats in human-specific genes.},

	abstract = {Background NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions have been associated with various neurogenerative disorders, including neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs). However, only a few NOTCH2NLC-related disease studies in IPN have been reported, and the clinical and genetic spectra remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic manifestations of NOTCH2NLC-related IPNs.
Method Among 2692 Japanese patients clinically diagnosed with IPN/Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), we analysed NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion in 1783 unrelated patients without a genetic diagnosis. Screening and repeat size determination of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion were performed using repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR.
Results NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions were identified in 26 cases of IPN/CMT from 22 unrelated families. The mean median motor nerve conduction velocity was 41 m/s (range, 30.8–59.4), and 18 cases (69\%) were classified as intermediate CMT. The mean age of onset was 32.7 (range, 7–61) years. In addition to motor sensory neuropathy symptoms, dysautonomia and involuntary movements were common (44\% and 29\%). Furthermore, the correlation between the age of onset or clinical symptoms and the repeat size remains unclear.
Conclusions These findings of this study help us understand the clinical heterogeneity of NOTCH2NLC-related disease, such as non-length-dependent motor dominant phenotype and prominent autonomic involvement. This study also emphasise the importance of genetic screening, regardless of the age of onset and type of CMT, particularly in patients of Asian origin, presenting with intermediate conduction velocities and dysautonomia.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative illness with characteristic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations: diffuse symmetric white-matter hyperintensities in lateral cerebral ventricle areas in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and high-intensity signals along the corticomedullary junction of the frontal–parietal–temporal lobes in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Here, we report a case of adult-onset NIID who was misdiagnosed with Susac syndrome (SS) due to unusual corpus callosum imaging findings.

Case presentation
A 39-year-old man presented with chronic headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, and numbness in the hands as initial symptoms, accompanied by cognitive slowing and decreased memory. Brain MRI revealed round hypointense lesions on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyperintense lesions on T2WI/FLAIR/DWI in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. An initial diagnosis of SS was made based on the presence of the SS-typical symptoms and SS-characteristic radiology changes. Furthermore, the patient’s symptoms improved upon completion of a combined pharmacotherapy plan. However, no significant changes were evident 18 months after the brain MRI scan. Eventually, the patient was then diagnosed with NIID based on a skin biopsy and detection of expanded GGC (guanine, guanine, cytosine) repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene.

Conclusion
The present NIID case in which there was simultaneous onset of altered nervous and visual system functioning and atypical imaging findings, the atypical imaging findings may reflect an initial change of NIID leukoencephalopathy.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by widespread intranuclear inclusions in the nervous system as well as multiple visceral organs. In 2019, expanded GGC repeats within the 5′ untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene was identified as the causative factor. NIID is a heterogeneous disorder with variable clinical manifestations including cognitive impairment, cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonism, paroxysmal symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and muscle weakness. Although NIID primarily affects the central and peripheral nervous systems, growing evidence suggests potential cardiac abnormalities in NIID. However, the link between expanded GGC repeats within NOTCH2NLC and cardiac dysfunction remains uncertain.

Results
In this study, we utilized two transgenic mouse models, expressing NOTCH2NLC-(GGC)98 ubiquitously or specifically in cardiomyocytes, and identified p62 (also known as sequestosome 1, SQSTM1)-positive intranuclear NOTCH2NLC-polyG inclusions in cardiomyocytes in two mouse models. We observed that both models exhibited cardiac-related pathological and echocardiographic changes, albeit exhibiting varying degrees of severity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed shared downregulation of genes related to ion channels and mitochondria in both models, with the cardiomyocyte-specific mice showing a more pronounced downregulation of mitochondria and energy metabolism-related pathways. Further investigations revealed decreased expression of mitochondria-related genes and electron transport chain activity. At last, we conducted a retrospective review of cardiac-related examination results from NIID patients at our hospital and also identified some cardiac abnormalities in NIID patients.

Conclusions
Our study provided the first in vivo evidence linking GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC to cardiac abnormalities and highlighted the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of cardiac abnormalities.

	abstract = {With complicated conditions and a large number of potentially causative genes, the diagnosis of a patient with complex inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) is challenging. To provide an overview of the genetic and clinical features of 39 families with complex IPNs from central south China and to optimize the molecular diagnosis approach to this group of heterogeneous diseases, a total of 39 index patients from unrelated families were enrolled, and detailed clinical data were collected. TTR Sanger sequencing, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) gene panel, and dynamic mutation detection in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCAs) were performed according to the respective additional clinical features. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used in patients with negative or unclear results. Dynamic mutation detection in NOTCH2NLC and RCF1 was applied as a supplement to WES. As a result, an overall molecular diagnosis rate of 89.7\% was achieved. All 21 patients with predominant autonomic dysfunction and multiple organ system involvement carried pathogenic variants in TTR, among which nine had c.349G {\textgreater} T (p.A97S) hotspot variants. Five out of 7 patients (71.4\%) with muscle involvement harbored biallelic pathogenic variants in GNE. Five out of 6 patients (83.3\%) with spasticity reached definite genetic causes in SACS, KIF5A, BSCL2, and KIAA0196, respectively. NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were identified in all three cases accompanied by chronic coughing and in one patient accompanied by cognitive impairment. The pathogenic variants, p.F284S and p.G111R in GNE, and p.K4326E in SACS, were first reported. In conclusion, transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), GNE myopathy, and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) were the most common genotypes in this cohort of complex IPNs. NOTCH2NLC dynamic mutation testing should be added to the molecular diagnostic workflow.

Most patients with NIID show polyneuropathy. Here, we aim to investigate diagnostic electrophysiological markers of NIID. Methods In this retrospective dual-center study, we reviewed 96 patients with NOTCH2NLC-related NIID, 94 patients with genetically confirmed Charcot–Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, and 62 control participants without history of peripheral neuropathy, who underwent nerve conduction studies between 2018 and 2022. Results Peripheral nerve symptoms were presented by 53.1\% of patients with NIID, whereas 97.9\% of them showed peripheral neuropathy according to electrophysiological examinations. Patients with NIID were characterized by slight demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy; some patients also showed mild axonal lesions. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) of the median nerve usually exceeded 35 m/s, and were found to be negatively correlated with the GGC repeat sizes. Regarding the electrophysiological differences between muscle weakness type (n = 27) and non-muscle weakness type (n = 69) of NIID, nerve conduction abnormalities were more severe in the muscle weakness type involving both demyelination and axonal impairment. Notably, specific DWI subcortical lace sign was presented in only 33.3\% of muscle weakness type, thus it was difficult to differentiate them from CMT. Combining age of onset, distal motor latency, and compound muscle action potential of the median nerve showed the optimal diagnostic performance to distinguish NIID from major CMT (AUC = 0.989, sensitivity = 92.6\%, specificity = 97.4\%). Interpretation Peripheral polyneuropathy is common in NIID. Our study suggest that nerve conduction study is useful to discriminate NIID.},

Detection of intranuclear inclusions remains the primary diagnostic criterion for NIID. Skin biopsies have traditionally been used, but concerns exist regarding postoperative complications and scarring. We sought to investigate the diagnostic utility of labial salivary gland biopsy, a less invasive alternative. Methods This study included a total of 19 patients and 11 asymptomatic carriers who underwent labial gland biopsies, while 10 patients opted for skin biopsies. All these individuals were confirmed to have pathogenic GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene. The control group comprised 20 individuals matched for age and sex, all with nonpathogenic GGC repeat expansions, and their labial gland tissue was sourced from oral surgery specimens. Results Labial gland biopsies proved to be a highly effective diagnostic method in detecting eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in NIID patients. The inclusions showed positive staining for p62 and ubiquitin, confirming their pathological significance. The presence of uN2CpolyG protein in the labial gland tissue further supported the diagnosis. Importantly, all patients who underwent lip gland biopsy experienced fast wound healing without any noticeable scarring. In contrast, skin biopsies led to varying degrees of scarring and one instance of a localized infection. Conclusion Labial salivary gland biopsy emerged as a minimally invasive, efficient diagnostic method for NIID, with rapid healing and excellent sensitivity.},

	abstract = {CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Previous studies indicated that the CGG repeats can be translated into polyglycine protein (N2CpolyG) which was toxic to neurons by forming intranuclear inclusions (IIs). However, little is known about the factors governing polyG IIs formation as well as its molecular pathogenesis. Considering that neurogenetic disorders usually involve interactions between genetic and environmental stresses, we investigated the effect of stress on the formation of IIs. Our results revealed that under hyperosmotic stress, N2CpolyG translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and formed IIs in SH-SY5Y cells, recapitulating the pathological hallmark of NIID patients. Furthermore, N2CpolyG interacted/ co-localized with an RNA-binding protein FUS in the IIs of cellular model and NIID patient tissues, thereby disrupting stress granule formation in cytoplasm under hyperosmotic stress. Consequently, dysregulated expression of microRNAs was found both in NIID patients and cellular model, which could be restored by FUS overexpression in cultured cells. Overall, our findings indicate a mechanism of stress-induced pathological changes as well as neuronal damage, and a potential strategy for the treatment of NIID.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID)-related retinopathy with guanine-guanine-cytosine repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC.

Materials and methods
Neuro-ophthalmic evaluations, including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP), ultrasound biomicroscopy, pupillometry, fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), Humphrey visual field, full-field electroretinography (ERG), and multifocal ERG (mf-ERG) were performed in patients with gene-proven NIID.

Results
Nine patients (18 eyes) were evaluated, with a median age of 62 years (55–68) and only one man was included in our study. Six patients presented with decreased visual acuity or night blindness, whereas the other three were asymptomatic. The visual acuity was measured from 20/200 to 20/20. Miosis was present in eight patients, four of whom had ciliary process hypertrophy and pronation, and three of whom had shallow anterior chambers. Fundus photography, FAF, and OCT showed consistent structural abnormalities mainly started from peripapillary areas and localized in the outer layer of photoreceptors and inner ganglion cell layer. ERG and mf-ERG also revealed retinal dysfunction in the corresponding regions.

Conclusion
Patients with NIID showed both structural and functional retinopathies which were unique and different from common cone-rod dystrophy or retinitis pigmentosa. Patients with miosis may have a potential risk of an angle-closure glaucoma attack. Neuro-ophthalmic evaluations is essential for evaluating patients with NIID, even without visual symptom.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose The role of GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neuron remains unclear. Here, we profile the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions in a large cohort of patients with PD. We also investigate the role of GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of SN. Methods A total of 2,522 patients diagnosed with PD and 1,085 health controls were analyzed for the repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC by repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR assay. Furthermore, the effects of GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC on dopaminergic neurons were investigated by using recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of NOTCH2NLC with 98 GGC repeats in the SN of mice by stereotactic injection. Results Four PD pedigrees (4/333, 1.2\%) and three sporadic PD patients (3/2189, 0.14\%) were identified with pathogenic GGC repeat expansions (larger than 60 GGC repeats) in the NOTCH2NLC gene, while eight PD patients and one healthy control were identified with intermediate GGC repeat expansions ranging from 41 to 60 repeats. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of intermediate NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions between PD cases and controls (Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.29). Skin biopsy showed P62-positive intranuclear NOTCH2NLC-polyGlycine (polyG) inclusions in the skin nerve fibers of patient. Expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC produced widespread intranuclear and perinuclear polyG inclusions, which led to a severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Consistently, polyG inclusions were presented in the SN of EIIa-NOTCH2NLC-(GGC)98 transgenic mice and also led to dopaminergic neuron loss in the SN. Conclusions Overall, our findings provide strong evidence that GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC contribute to the pathogenesis of PD and cause degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons.},

Although episodic neurogenic events can be associated with NIID, no reported cases have demonstrated concurrent clinical features or MRI findings resembling reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Here, we present the inaugural case of an adult-onset NIID patient who initially displayed symptoms reminiscent of RCVS. The 59-year-old male patient’s initial presentation included a thunderclap headache, right visual field deficit, and confusion. Although his brain MRI appeared normal, MR angiography unveiled left posterior cerebral artery occlusion, subsequently followed by recanalization, culminating in an RCVS diagnosis. Over an 11-year period, the patient encountered 10 additional episodes, each escalating in duration and intensity, accompanied by seizures. Simultaneously, cognitive impairment progressed. Genetic testing for NIID revealed an abnormal expansion of GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC, with a count of 115 (normal range, {\textless}60), and this patient was diagnosed with NIID. Our report highlights that NIID can clinically and radiologically mimic RCVS. Therefore, in the differential diagnosis of RCVS, particularly in cases with atypical features or recurrent episodes, consideration of NIID is warranted. Additionally, the longitudinal neuroimaging findings provided the course of NIID over an 11-year follow-up period.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a highly clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder primarily attributed to abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the \textit{NOTCH2NLC} gene. This study aims to comprehensively explore its phenotypic characteristics and genotype-phenotype correlation. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from September 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022, encompassing reported NIID cases confirmed by pathogenic \textit{NOTCH2NLC} mutations. Linear regressions and trend analyses were performed. Analyzing 635 cases from 85 included studies revealed that familial cases exhibited significantly larger GGC repeat expansions than sporadic cases (\textit{p} {\textless} 0.001), and this frequency significantly increased with expanding GGC repeats (\textit{p} trend {\textless} 0.001). Age at onset (AAO) showed a negative correlation with GGC repeat expansions (\textit{p} {\textless} 0.001). The predominant initial symptoms included tremor (31.70\%), cognitive impairment (14.12\%), and muscle weakness (10.66\%). The decreased or absent tendon reflex (DTR/ATR) emerged as a notable clinical indicator of NIID due to its high prevalence. U-fiber was observed in 79.11\% of patients, particularly prominent in paroxysmal disease-dominant (87.50\%) and dementia-dominant cases (81.08\%). Peripheral neuropathy-dominant cases exhibited larger GGC repeat expansions (median = 123.00) and an earlier AAO (median = 33.00) than other phenotypes. Moreover, a significant genetic anticipation of 3.5 years was observed (\textit{p} = 0.039). This study provides a comprehensive and up-to-date compilation of genotypic and phenotypic information on NIID since the identification of the causative gene\textit{ NOTCH2NLC}. We contribute a novel diagnostic framework for NIID to support clinical practice.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Five years prior, bradykinesia and hypermyotonia had become apparent. She had urinary incontinence and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. She was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and received levodopa and pramipexole, which relieved her motor symptoms. During hospitalization, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed a high-intensity signal along the cortical medullary junction. Moreover, a skin biopsy revealed the presence of intranuclear inclusions in adipocytes, fibroblasts, and sweat gland cells. NIID was diagnosed by testing the Notch 2 N-terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. We report this case to remind doctors to consider NIID when diagnosing patients with symptoms indicative of Parkinson’s disease.

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder represented by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions (EIIs) and GGC/CGG repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. We report here two adult cases of NIID, genetically confirmed, with manifestation of encephalopathy-like symptoms and address the histopathologic findings obtained by brain biopsies, with a focus on “astrocytic” intranuclear inclusions (AIIs). Case 1 presented with paroxysmal restlessness, vertigo, or fever and was later involved in severe dementia and tetraparesis. Case 2 presented with forgetfulness and then with paroxysmal fever and headache. In both cases, delimited areas with gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging and corresponding hyperperfusion were detected, leading to brain biopsies of the cortex. On histology, Case 1 showed an abnormal lamination, where the thickness of layers was different from usual. Both neurons and astrocytes showed some dysmorphologic features. Notably, astrocytes rather than neurons harbored EIIs. Case 2 showed a cortex, where neurons tended to be arrayed in a columnar fashion. Astrocytes showed some dysmorphologic features. Notably, much more astrocytes than neurons harbored EIIs. By a double-labeling immunofluorescence study for p62/NeuN and p62/glial fibrillary acidic protein, the predominance of AIIs was confirmed in both cases. Considering the physiological functions of astrocytes for the development and maintenance of the cortex, the encephalopathy-like symptoms, dynamic change of cerebral blood flow, and cortical dysmorphology can reasonably be explained by the dysfunction of EII-bearing astrocytes rather than EII-bearing neurons. This study suggests the presence of a subtype of NIID where AIIs rather than “neuronal” intranuclear inclusions are likely a key player in the pathogenesis of NIID, particularly in cases with encephalopathy-like symptoms. The importance of AIIs (“gliopathy”) should be more appreciated in future studies of NIID.},

Investigating the frequency of repeat expansions in ALS in different populations and ethnic groups is therefore of great importance. Based on these premises, this study aimed to define the frequency of REs in the NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC genes and the possible associations between phenotypes and the size of REs in the Italian population. Using repeat-primed-PCR and PCR-fragment analyses, we screened 302 El-Escorial-diagnosed ALS patients and compared the RE distribution to 167 age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. While the REs distribution was similar between the ALS and control groups, a moderate association was observed between longer RE lengths and clinical features such as age at onset, gender, site of onset, and family history. In conclusion, this is the first study to screen ALS patients from southern Italy for REs in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC genes, contributing to our understanding of ALS genetics. Our results highlighted that the extremely rare pathogenic REs in these genes do not allow an association with the disease.},

Infant, junior, and adult patients with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) present with various types of seizures. We aimed to conduct a systematic literature review on the clinical characteristics of NIID with seizures to provide novel insight for early diagnosis and treatment and to improve prognosis of these patients.

Methods
We used keywords to screen articles related to NIID and seizures, and data concerning the clinical characteristics of patients, including demographic features, disease characteristics of the seizures, treatment responses, imaging examinations, and other auxiliary examination results were extracted.

Results
The included studies comprised 21 patients with NIID with seizures. The most common clinical phenotypes were cognitive impairment (76.20\%) and impaired consciousness (57.14\%), and generalized onset motor seizures (46.15\%) represented the most common type. Compared with infantile and juvenile cases, the use of antiepileptic drugs in adults led to significant seizure control and symptom improvement, in addition to providing a better prognosis. The number of GGC sequence repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene in six NIID patients with seizures who underwent genetic testing ranged 72–134.

Conclusion
The most common clinical phenotypes in patients with NIID with seizures were cognitive impairment and consciousness disorders. Patients with NIID presented with various types of seizures, with the most common being generalized onset motor seizures. Adult patients had a better prognosis and were relatively stable. The early diagnosis of NIID with seizures is of great significance for treatment and to improve prognosis.},

	abstract = {The unclear pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders stemming from NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions drive focused research. Thus, a bibliometric and meta-analysis was conducted to uncover research trends and positivity rates in NOTCH2NLC. We conducted systematic searches in the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases for studies related to NOTCH2NLC up until August 2, 2023. Information regarding countries, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords of studies included in the Web of Science was analyzed and visualized. The positivity rates of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions across all screened patients and patients’ families were pooled under the random-effects model. Publication bias and its impact were examined using funnel plots, Egger’s linear regression, and trim-and-fill method. The bibliometric analysis, revealing pronounced publication growth, comprised 119 studies, which came from China and Japan particularly. “Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease” emerged as a frequently used keyword. The meta-analysis comprised 36 studies, indicating global positivity rates of 1.79\% (95\% CI, 0.75–3.17) for all patients and 2.00\% (95\% CI, 0.26–4.78) for patients’ families. Subgroup analyses based on region and phenotype suggested the highest NOTCH2NLC positivity rates in Taiwan population (5.42\%, 95\% CI 0.08–16.89) and in leukoencephalopathy-dominant patients (8.25\%, 95\% CI, 3.01–15.60). Sensitivity analysis affirmed the robustness of results. In conclusion, NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions exhibit rare globally, primarily in East Asia, and leukoencephalopathy-dominant patients, emphasizing regional and phenotypic distinctions. Emerging focal points in NOTCH2NLC researches underscore the need for collaborative exploration.},

	abstract = {Objective
Essential Tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders. In most instances ET is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with age-related penetrance (virtually complete in advanced age); however, ET genetics remains elusive. The current study aims to identify possibly pathogenic genetic variants in a group of well-characterized ET families.
Methods
34 individuals from 14 families with dominant ET were clinically evaluated and studied by whole exome sequencing studies (after excluding trinucleotide expansion disorders).
Results
Most patients had pure ET. In 4 families, exome studies could identify a genetic variant potentially able to significantly alter the protein structure (CADD {\textgreater}20, REVEL score {\textgreater} 0.25), shared by all the affected individuals (in CAMTA1, FUS, MYH14, SGCE genes). In another family there were two variants in dominant genes (PCDH9 and SQSTM1). Moreover, an interrupted “intermediate” trinucleotide expansion in ATXN1 (“SCA1”) was identified in a further family with pure ET.
Conclusion
Combining our observations together with earlier reports, we can conclude that ET genes confirmed in at least two families to date include CAMTA1 and FUS (reported here), as well as CACNA1G, NOTCH2NLC and TENM4. Most cases of familial ET, inherited with an autosomal dominant inheritance, may result from “mild” variants of many different genes that, when affected by more harmful genetic variants, lead to more severe neurological syndromes (still autosomal dominant). Thus, ET phenotype may be the “mild”, incomplete manifestation of many other dominant neurogenetic diseases. These findings further support evidence of genetic heterogeneity for such disease(s).

In vitro-transcribed biotinylated RNA containing hexanucleotide GGGGCC or, as control, AAAACC repeats were incubated with nuclear protein extracts. Using stringent filtering protocols 20 RNA-binding proteins with a variety of different functions in RNA metabolism, translation and transport were identified. A subset of these proteins was further investigated by immunohistochemistry in human autopsy brains. This revealed that hnRNP A3 formed neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in the hippocampus of patients with C9orf72 repeat extensions. Confocal microcopy showed that these inclusions belong to the group of the so far enigmatic p62-positive/TDP-43 negative inclusions characteristically seen in autopsy cases of diseased C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers.

	abstract = {Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that around 250 human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, harbour a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a ‘steric zipper’ motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.},

	abstract = {Lamins, members of the family of intermediate filaments, form a supportive nucleoskeletal structure underlying the nuclear envelope and can also form intranuclear structures. Mutations within the A-type lamin gene cause a variety of degenerative diseases which are collectively referred to as laminopathies. At the molecular level, laminopathies have been shown to be linked to a discontinuous localization pattern of A-type lamins, with some laminopathies containing nuclear lamin A aggregates. Since nuclear aggregate formation could lead to the mislocalization of proteins interacting with A-type lamins, we set out to examine the effects of FLAG-lamin A N195K and R386K protein aggregate formation on the subnuclear distribution of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the sterol responsive element binding protein 1a (SREBP1a) after coexpression as GFP-fusion proteins in HeLa cells. We observed strong recruitment of both proteins into nuclear aggregates. Nuclear aggregate recruitment of the NPC component nucleoporin NUP153 was also observed and found to be dependent on the N-terminus. That these effects were specific was implied by the fact that a number of other coexpressed karyophilic GFP-fusion proteins, such as the nucleoporin NUP98 and kanadaptin, did not coaggregate with FLAG-lamin A N195K or R386K. Immunofluorescence analysis further indicated that the precursor form of lamin A, pre-lamin A, could be found in intranuclear aggregates. Our results imply that redistribution into lamin A-/pre-lamin A-containing aggregates of proteins such as pRb and SREBP1a could represent a key aspect underlying the molecular pathogenesis of certain laminopathies.},

The pathologic hallmark of FXTAS is the ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusion found in neurons and astrocytes in broad distribution throughout the brain. The pathogenesis of FXTAS is likely to involve an RNA toxic gain-of-function mechanism, and the FMR1 mRNA has recently been identified within the inclusions. However, little is known about the proteins that mediate the abnormal cellular response to the expanded CGG repeat allele. As one approach to identify the protein mediators, we have endeavoured to define the protein complement of the inclusion itself. Fluorescence-activated flow-based methods have been developed for the efficient purification of inclusions from the post-mortem brain tissue of FXTAS patients. Mass spectrometric analysis of the entire protein complement of the isolated inclusions, combined with immunohistochemical analysis of both isolated nuclei and tissue sections, has been used to identify inclusion-associated proteins. More than 20 inclusion-associated proteins have been identified on the basis of combined immunohistochemical and mass spectrometric analysis, including a number of neurofilaments and lamin A/C. There is no dominant protein species in the inclusions, and ubiquitinated proteins represent only a minor component; thus, inclusion formation is not likely to reflect a breakdown in proteasomal degradation of nuclear proteins. The list of proteins includes at least two RNA binding proteins, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 and muscle blind-like protein 1, which are possible mediators of the RNA gain-of-function in FXTAS.},

The hnRNP A/B family of proteins (comprised of A1, A2/B1, A3, and A0) contributes to the regulation of the majority of cellular RNAs. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of what is known of each protein’s functions, highlighting important differences between them. While there is extensive information about A1 and A2/B1, we found that even the basic functions of the A0 and A3 proteins have not been well-studied. We also noted that the regulation and tissue distribution of all four of the proteins and their different isoforms require further study. Finally, since these proteins together play such a central role in regulating the cell’s RNA, we call for careful comparative examination of these proteins to better define the precise boundaries of each protein’s role in cell function and disease.

Abstract
The hnRNP A/B family of proteins is canonically central to cellular RNA metabolism, but due to their highly conserved nature, the functional differences between hnRNP A1, A2/B1, A0, and A3 are often overlooked. In this review, we explore and identify the shared and disparate homeostatic and disease-related functions of the hnRNP A/B family proteins, highlighting areas where the proteins have not been clearly differentiated. Herein, we provide a comprehensive assembly of the literature on these proteins. We find that there are critical gaps in our grasp of A/B proteins’ alternative splice isoforms, structures, regulation, and tissue and cell-type-specific functions, and propose that future mechanistic research integrating multiple A/B proteins will significantly improve our understanding of how this essential protein family contributes to cell homeostasis and disease.},

	abstract = {Background Human sweat glands are heterogeneous in their structures and functions. Accordingly, eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine glands are distinguished. Aims Some immunohistochemical markers are expected to distinguish the sweat gland types in their secretory and excretory parts. Methods This study used two sets of antibodies. The first panel was composed of antibodies directed to well-defined sweat gland structures. The molecular targets included the low-molecular-weight cytokeratins CAM 5.2, the S100-B protein, the epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1). A second exploratory panel of antibodies targeted syndecan-1 (CD138), NKI-C3 (CD63), and CD68. They were used to disclose some undescribed antigen expressions in human sweat glands. Results The first set of antibodies confirmed previous findings. The immunoreactivities of the three sweat gland types were similar in the excretory ducts. By contrast, they were distinguished in the deeper coiled secretory portions of the glands. Conclusion Clues supporting their distinction and probably their functional activity were obtained by immunohistochemistry using the S100-B protein, CEA and CD63 antibodies. The immunoreactivity to the S100-B protein, CEA and CD63 possibly help identifying apoeccrine sweat glands or a peculiar functional activity of eccrine sweat glands.},

	abstract = {Adipocytes, once considered simple lipid-storing cells, are rapidly emerging as complex cells with many biologically diverse functions. A powerful high-throughput method for analyzing single cells is flow cytometry. Several groups have attempted to analyze and sort freshly isolated adipocytes; however, using an adipocyte-specific reporter mouse, we demonstrate that these studies fail to detect the majority of white adipocytes. We define critical settings required for adipocyte flow cytometry and provide a rigid strategy for analyzing and sorting white and brown adipocyte populations. The applicability of our protocol is shown by sorting mouse adipocytes based on size or UCP1 expression and demonstrating that a subset of human adipocytes lacks the β2-adrenergic receptor, particularly in the insulin-resistant state. In conclusion, the present study confers key technological insights for analyzing and sorting mature adipocytes, opening up numerous downstream research applications.,

	abstract = {Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders, with a reported {\textgreater}60 million affected individuals worldwide. The definition and underlying pathophysiology of ET are contentious. Patients present primarily with motor features such as postural and action tremors, but may also have other non-motor features, including cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Genetics account for most of the ET risk but environmental factors may also be involved. However, the variable penetrance and challenges in validating data make gene–environment analysis difficult. Structural changes in cerebellar Purkinje cells and neighbouring neuronal populations have been observed in post-mortem studies, and other studies have found GABAergic dysfunction and dysregulation of the cerebellar–thalamic–cortical circuitry. Commonly prescribed medications include propranolol and primidone. Deep brain stimulation and ultrasound thalamotomy are surgical options in patients with medically intractable ET. Further research in post-mortem studies, and animal and cell-based models may help identify new pathophysiological clues and therapeutic targets and, together with advances in omics and machine learning, may facilitate the development of precision medicine for patients with ET.},

	abstract = {The human reference genome assembly plays a central role in nearly all aspects of today's basic and clinical research. GRCh38 is the first coordinate-changing assembly update since 2009; it reflects the resolution of roughly 1000 issues and encompasses modifications ranging from thousands of single base changes to megabase-scale path reorganizations, gap closures, and localization of previously orphaned sequences. We developed a new approach to sequence generation for targeted base updates and used data from new genome mapping technologies and single haplotype resources to identify and resolve larger assembly issues. For the first time, the reference assembly contains sequence-based representations for the centromeres. We also expanded the number of alternate loci to create a reference that provides a more robust representation of human population variation. We demonstrate that the updates render the reference an improved annotation substrate, alter read alignments in unchanged regions, and impact variant interpretation at clinically relevant loci. We additionally evaluated a collection of new de novo long-read haploid assemblies and conclude that although the new assemblies compare favorably to the reference with respect to continuity, error rate, and gene completeness, the reference still provides the best representation for complex genomic regions and coding sequences. We assert that the collected updates in GRCh38 make the newer assembly a more robust substrate for comprehensive analyses that will promote our understanding of human biology and advance our efforts to improve health.},

We benchmark Flye against five state-of-the-art assemblers and show that it generates better or comparable assemblies, while being an order of magnitude faster.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Traditional methods for the analysis of repeat expansions, which underlie genetic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), lack single-nucleotide resolution in repeat analysis and the ability to characterize causative variants outside the repeat array. These drawbacks can be overcome by long-read and short-read sequencing, respectively. However, the routine application of next-generation sequencing in the clinic requires target enrichment, and none of the available methods allows parallel analysis of long-DNA fragments using both sequencing technologies. In this study, we investigated the use of indirect sequence capture (Xdrop technology) coupled to Nanopore and Illumina sequencing to characterize {\textless}italic{\textgreater}FMR1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, the gene responsible of FXS. We achieved the efficient enrichment (\&gt; 200×) of large target DNA fragments ({\textasciitilde}60–80 kbp) encompassing the entire {\textless}italic{\textgreater}FMR1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene. The analysis of Xdrop-enriched samples by Nanopore long-read sequencing allowed the complete characterization of repeat lengths in samples with normal, pre-mutation, and full mutation status (\&gt; 1 kbp), and correctly identified repeat interruptions relevant for disease prognosis and transmission. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) could be detected in the same samples by Illumina short-read sequencing, completing the mutational testing through the identification of pathogenic variants within the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}FMR1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene, when no typical CGG repeat expansion is detected. The study successfully demonstrated the parallel analysis of repeat expansions and SNVs/indels in the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}FMR1{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene at single-nucleotide resolution by combining Xdrop enrichment with two next-generation sequencing approaches. With the appropriate optimization necessary for the clinical settings, the system could facilitate both the study of genotype–phenotype correlation in FXS and enable a more efficient diagnosis and genetic counseling for patients and their relatives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

	abstract = {Continuously cultured human neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE(1), SK-N-BE(2), and SK-N-MC, as well as several clonally derived sublines, were assessed for their neurotransmitter characteristics. Two different methods were used: measurement of cholinergic and adrenergic enzyme activities and detection of neurotransmitters synthesized from radioactive precursors. Dopamine-β-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.2.1), choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6), acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), and butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) levels were compared to those of various normal and neuronal cell controls. The capacity of neuroblastoma lines and clones to convert radioactive tyrosine, choline, and glutamate to transmitter products was determined. SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE(1), and SK-N-BE(2) cells had moderately high levels of dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity. Whereas neuroblast-like clones of SK-N-SH had similar levels of this enzyme, epithelial-like clones had no detectable activity. SK-N-BE(2) cells showed the greatest capacity to convert tyrosine to dopamine. Although the SK-N-SH line itself was not tested, both neuroblast and epithelial-like clones, shown by karyotype analysis to have a common cell precursor, converted tyrosine to dopamine. In contrast, the SK-N-MC line and its clones appeared devoid of adrenergic properties. All cells tested except human fibroblast-like cells of normal origin were able to convert radioactive choline to acetylcholine. While all the cell lines had measurable choline acetyltransferase activity, levels were substantially higher (at least 4- to 12-fold) for SK-N-MC cells and its clonally derived subline MC-IXC. All cells tested converted glutamate to γ-aminobutyric acid. Results indicate that these human neuroblastoma cell lines have predominating neurotransmitter characteristics that are sometimes, but not always, expressed in clones derived from them. Since the SK-N-BE(1) and SK-N-BE(2) lines were isolated 5 months apart from the same patient and have similar activity levels of dopamine-β-hydroxylase, these characteristics may be stable and representative of the tumor cells in vivo. Furthermore, results obtained by the two different methodological approaches suggest that, whereas SK-N-MC cells show cholinergic and not adrenergic traits, SK-N-SH and possibly SK-N-BE(2) may be multipotential with regard to neuronal enzyme expression.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating and highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease for which only symptomatic treatment is available. In order to develop a truly effective disease-modifying therapy, improvement of our current understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis and progression is crucial. For this purpose, standardization of research protocols and disease models is necessary. As human dopaminergic neurons, the cells mainly affected in PD, are difficult to obtain and maintain as primary cells, current PD research is mostly performed with permanently established neuronal cell models, in particular the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y lineage. This cell line is frequently chosen because of its human origin, catecholaminergic (though not strictly dopaminergic) neuronal properties, and ease of maintenance. However, there is no consensus on many fundamental aspects that are associated with its use, such as the effects of culture media composition and of variations in differentiation protocols. Here we present the outcome of a systematic review of scientific articles that have used SH-SY5Y cells to explore PD. We describe the cell source, culture conditions, differentiation protocols, methods/approaches used to mimic PD and the preclinical validation of the SH-SY5Y findings by employing alternative cellular and animal models. Thus, this overview may help to standardize the use of the SH-SY5Y cell line in PD research and serve as a future user’s guide.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset motor neuron disorder, is fatal for most patients less than 3 years from when the first symptoms appear. The aetiologies for sporadic and most familial forms of ALS are unknown, but genetic factors are increasingly recognized as causal in a subset of patients. Studies of disease physiology suggest roles for oxidative stress, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity or protein aggregation; how these pathways interact in the complex pathophysiology of ALS awaits elucidation. Cellular models are being used to examine disease mechanisms. Recent advances include the availability of expanded cell types, from neuronal or glial cell culture to motoneuron–astrocyte co-culture genetically or environmentally modified. Cell culture experiments confirmed the central role of glial cells in ALS. The recent adaptation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for ALS modeling could allow a broader perspective and is expected to generate new hypotheses, related particularly to mechanisms underlying genetic factors. Cellular models have provided meaningful advances in the understanding of ALS, but, to date, complete characterization of in vitro models is only partially described. Consensus on methodological approaches, strategies for validation and techniques that allow rapid adaptation to new genetic or environmental influences is needed. In this article, we review the principal cellular models being employed in ALS and highlight their contribution to the understanding of disease mechanisms. We conclude with recommendations on means to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the different concepts for experimental ALS.},

In monolayer culture both cell lines form disoriented growth patterns and reach high saturation densities. Population-doubling times were 44 and 32 hr for SK-N-SH and SK-N-MC, respectively. Inoculum levels of 107 cells of both lines produced tumors confirmed by histopathological examination, at frequencies of 30 to 40\% in cheek pouches of conditioned Syrian hamsters. SK-N-SH cells are characterized by high dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity while SK-N-MC cells have no detectable activity. However, for SK-N-MC but not SK-N-SH, the presence of intracellular catecholamine was indicated by formaldehyde-induced fluorescence. The lines are near-diploid with several chromosomal markers; SK-N-MC cells contain double-minute chromosomes.

METHODS: A patient who had visited the First People's Hospital of Chenzhou on August 6, 2023 was selected as the study subject. Results of clinical examination, neuroimaging, and genetic testing were retrospectively analyzed along with a literature review. The number of GGC trinucleotide repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene was determined by GC-PCR.
RESULTS: The patient had presented with episodic encephalopathy, with enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showing enhancement features of the posterior cerebral cortex during the period of acute episode. Genetic testing revealed an increased number of GGC repeats (n = 97) in the 5'- untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene, which confirmed the diagnosis of NIID.
CONCLUSION: Clinical attention should be paid to the enhanced MRI findings of patients with adult-onset NIID, for whom posterior cortical enhancement may be characteristic manifestation during the acute phase of encephalopathy-like episode.},

	abstract = {Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of GGC trinucleotide repeats in NOTCH2NLC gene. Despite identifying uN2CpolyG, a toxic polyglycine (polyG) protein translated by expanded GGC repeats, the exact pathogenic mechanisms of NIID remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of polyG by expressing various forms of NOTCH2NLC in mice: the wild-type, the expanded form with 100 GGC repeats (either translating or not translating into uN2CpolyG), and the mutated form that encodes a pure polyG without GGC-repeat RNA and the C-terminal stretch (uN2CpolyG-dCT). Both uN2CpolyG and uN2CpolyG-dCT induced the formation of inclusions composed by filamentous materials and resulted in neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice, including impaired motor and cognitive performance, shortened lifespan, and pathologic lesions such as white-matter lesions, microgliosis, and astrogliosis. In contrast, expressing GGC-repeat RNA alone was non-pathogenic. Through bulk and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, we identified common molecular signatures linked to the expression of uN2CpolyG and uN2CpolyG-dCT, particularly the upregulation of inflammation and microglia markers, and the downregulation of immediate early genes and splicing factors. Importantly, microglia-mediated inflammation was visualized in NIID patients using positron emission tomography, correlating with levels of white-matter atrophy. Furthermore, microglia ablation ameliorated neurodegenerative phenotypes and transcriptional alterations in uN2CpolyG-expressing mice but did not affect polyG inclusions. Together, these results demonstrate that polyG is crucial for the pathogenesis of NIID and highlight the significant role of microglia in polyG-induced neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {The expansion of GGC repeats within NOTCH2NLC leads to the translation of the uN2CpolyG protein, the primary pathogenic factor in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). This study aims to explore the deposition of uN2CpolyG as an amyloid in the vessel wall, leading to uN2CpolyG cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)-related cerebral microbleeds (CMBs).A total of 97 patients with genetically confirmed NIID were enrolled in this study. We analyzed the presence of CMBs using susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences and compared general clinical information, cerebrovascular risk factors, stroke history, antiplatelet medication use, and MRI features between NIID patients with and without CMBs. We further performed hematoxylin and eosin (H\&amp;E), Perl’s, Congo red, and Thioflavin S staining, ubiquitin, p62 and uN2CpolyG immunostaining on brain tissue obtained from four NIID patients.A total of 354 CMBs were detected among 41 patients with NIID, with nearly half located in the deep brain, one-third in the lobes, and approximately 20\% in the infratentorial area. No significant differences in cerebrovascular disease risk factors or history of antiplatelet drug use were observed between patients with and without CMBs. However, patients with CMBs suffered a higher incidence of previous ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke events. This group also had a higher incidence of recent subcortical infarcts and a higher proportion of white matter lesions in the external capsule and temporal pole. Conversely, patients without CMBs showed higher detection of high signals at the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging and more pronounced brain atrophy.H\&amp;E staining showed blood vessel leakage and hemosiderin-laden macrophage clusters, and Prussian blue staining revealed brain tissue iron deposition. CMBs occurred more frequently in small vessels lacking intranuclear inclusions, and extensive degeneration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle fibres was observed mainly in vessels lacking inclusions. Congo red-positive amyloid deposition was observed in the cerebral vessels of NIID patients, with disordered filamentous fibres appearing under an electron microscope. Additionally, the co-localization of Thioflavin S-labeled amyloid and uN2CpolyG protein in the cerebral vascular walls of NIID patients further suggested that uN2CpolyG is the main pathogenic protein in this form of amyloid angiopathy.In conclusion, we reviewed patients with GGC repeat expansion of NOTCH2NLC from a novel perspective, providing initial clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological evidence suggesting that uN2CpolyG may contribute to a distinct type of CAA.},

In this study, we identify such variants in the human-specific NOTCH2NL gene family, which were recently identified as possible contributors to the evolutionary expansion of the human brain. We find evidence for the existence of unique protein-coding NOTCH2NL variants in Neanderthals and Denisovans which could affect their ability to activate Notch signaling. Furthermore, in the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes, we find unusual NOTCH2NL configurations, not found in any of the modern human genomes analyzed. Finally, genetic analysis of archaic and modern humans reveals ongoing adaptive evolution of modern human NOTCH2NL genes, identifying three structural variants acting complementary to drive our genome to produce a lower dosage of NOTCH2NL protein. Because copy-number variations of the 1q21.1 locus, encompassing NOTCH2NL genes, are associated with severe neurological disorders, this seemingly contradicting drive toward low levels of NOTCH2NL protein indicates that the optimal dosage of NOTCH2NL may have not yet been settled in the human population.},

Similarly, the composition and dynamics of mature tRNA populations in cells in terms of isoacceptor abundances, and the prevalence and function of base modifications are not well understood. As we begin to decipher some of the rules that govern codon usage and tRNA abundances, it is becoming clear that these parameters are a way to not only increase gene expression, but also regulate the speed of ribosomal translation, the efficiency of protein folding, and the coordinated expression of functionally related gene families. Here, we discuss the importance of codon–anticodon interactions in translation regulation and highlight the contribution of non-random codon distributions and post-transcriptional base modifications to this regulation.},

	abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder, caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3′-untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The repeat expansion is somatically unstable and tends to increase in length with time, contributing to disease progression. In some individuals, the repeat array is interrupted by variant repeats such as CCG and CGG, stabilising the expansion and often leading to milder symptoms. We have characterised three families, each including one person with variant repeats that had arisen de novo on paternal transmission of the repeat expansion. Two individuals were identified for screening due to an unusual result in the laboratory diagnostic test, and the third due to exceptionally mild symptoms. The presence of variant repeats in all three expanded alleles was confirmed by restriction digestion of small pool PCR products, and allele structures were determined by PacBio sequencing. Each was different, but all contained CCG repeats close to the 3′-end of the repeat expansion. All other family members had inherited pure CTG repeats. The variant repeat-containing alleles were more stable in the blood than pure alleles of similar length, which may in part account for the mild symptoms observed in all three individuals. This emphasises the importance of somatic instability as a disease mechanism in DM1. Further, since patients with variant repeats may have unusually mild symptoms, identification of these individuals has important implications for genetic counselling and for patient stratification in DM1 clinical trials.},

Male gametic heterogeneity of the expanded repeat is demonstrated using single sperm and low–copy genome analysis. Low–copy genome analysis of peripheral blood also reveals somatic heterogeneity of the expanded SCA1 allele, thus establishing mitotic instability at this locus. Comparative analysis of a large normal allele and a small affected allele suggests a role of midstream CAT interspersions in stabilizing long (CAG)n stretches. Within the brain, tissue–specific mosaicism of the expanded allele is also observed. The differences in SCA1 allele heterogeneity between sperm and blood and within the brain parallels the findings in Huntington disease, suggesting that both disorders share a common mechanism for tissue–specific instability.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A wide variety of bioinformatic tools have been described to characterize potential transcriptional regulatory mechanisms based on genomic sequence analysis and microarray hybridization studies. However, these regulatory mechanisms are still experimentally verified using transient transfection methods. Current transfection methods are limited both by their large scale and by the low level of efficiency for certain cell types. Our goals were to develop a microarray-based transfection method that could be optimized for different cell types and that would be useful in reporter assays of transcriptional regulation. Here we describe a novel transfection method, termed STEP (surface transfection and expression protocol), which employs microarray-based DNA transfection of adherent cells in the functional analysis of transcriptional regulation. In STEP, recombinant proteins with biological activities designed to enhance transfection are complexed with expression vector DNAs prior to spotting on microscope slides. The recombinant proteins used in STEP complexes can be varied to increase the efficiency for different cell types. We demonstrate that STEP efficiently transfects both supercoiled plasmids and PCR-generated linear expression cassettes. A co-transfection assay using effector expression vectors encoding the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), as well as reporter vectors containing PKA-regulated promoters, showed that STEP transfection allows detection and quantitation of transcriptional regulation by this protein kinase. Because bioinformatic studies often result in the identification of many putative regulatory elements and signaling pathways, this approach should be of utility in high-throughput functional genomic studies of transcriptional regulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mammalian expression systems are used routinely for the production of recombinant proteins as therapeutic molecules as well as research tools. Transient expression has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its rapid timeline and improvements in expression level. While improvements to transient expression systems have focused mainly on the level of protein expression, the aspect of protein quality has received little attention. The removal of undesirable products, such as aggregation, depends primarily on purification, requiring additional cumbersome steps, which can lead to a lower product yield and longer timelines. In this study, we show that reducing the level of transcription by transfecting at a lower gene dose improves the quality of secreted molecules prone to aggregation. For gene dosing to have this effect, it is critical for the carrier DNA to be an empty vector containing the same elements as the gene containing plasmid. This approach can be used in combination with a temperature shift to hypothermic conditions during production to enhance the effect. The observed improvements not only minimized aggregation levels, but also generated products with overall superior quality, including more homogeneous signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation profiles. These techniques have produced a similar improvement in product quality with a variety of other molecules, suggesting that this may be a general approach to enhance product quality from transient expression systems. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

	abstract = {In selective autophagy, cytoplasmic components are selected and tagged before being sequestered into an autophagosome by means of selective autophagy receptors such as p62/SQSTM1. In this review, we discuss how selective autophagy is regulated. An important level of regulation is the selection of proteins or organelles for degradation. Components selected for degradation are tagged, often with ubiquitin, to facilitate recognition by autophagy receptors. Another level of regulation is represented by the autophagy receptors themselves. For p62, its ability to co-aggregate with ubiquitinated substrates is strongly induced by post-translational modifications (PTMs). The transcription of p62 is also markedly increased during conditions in which selective autophagy substrates accumulate. For other autophagy receptors, the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif is regulated by PTMs, inhibiting or stimulating the interaction with ATG8 family proteins. ATG8 proteins are also regulated by PTMs. Regulation of the capacity of the core autophagy machinery also affects selective autophagy. Importantly, autophagy receptors can induce local recruitment and activation of ULK1/2 and PI3KC3 complexes at the site of cargo sequestration.},

Two mechanisms are proposed to cause FXTAS: RNA gain-of-function, where CGG RNA sequesters specific proteins, and translation of CGG repeats into a polyglycine-containing protein, FMRpolyG. Here we developed transgenic mice expressing CGG repeat RNA with or without FMRpolyG. Expression of FMRpolyG is pathogenic, while the sole expression of CGG RNA is not. FMRpolyG interacts with the nuclear lamina protein LAP2β and disorganizes the nuclear lamina architecture in neurons differentiated from FXTAS iPS cells. Finally, expression of LAP2β rescues neuronal death induced by FMRpolyG. Overall, these results suggest that translation of expanded CGG repeats into FMRpolyG alters nuclear lamina architecture and drives pathogenesis in FXTAS.},

Neuropathological studies have shown that neuronal loss is largely restricted to the cerebellum. Although the repeat locus is highly unstable during intergenerational transmission, it remains unknown whether it exhibits cerebral mosaicism and progressive instability throughout life.We conducted an analysis of the FGF14 GAA•TTC repeat somatic instability across 156 serial blood samples from 69 individuals, fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells, and post-mortem brain tissues from six controls and six patients with SCA27B, alongside methylation profiling using targeted long-read sequencing. Peripheral tissues exhibited minimal somatic instability, which did not significantly change over periods of more than 20 years. In post-mortem brains, the GAA•TTC repeat was remarkably stable across all regions, except in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. The levels of somatic expansion in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were, on average, 3.15 and 2.72 times greater relative to other examined brain regions, respectively. Additionally, levels of somatic expansion in the brain increased with repeat length and tissue expression of FGF14. We found no significant difference in methylation of wild-type and expanded FGF14 alleles in post-mortem cerebellar hemispheres between patients and controls.In conclusion, our study revealed that the FGF14 GAA•TTC repeat exhibits a cerebellar-specific expansion bias, which may explain the pure cerebellar involvement in SCA27B.},

Consequently, a plethora of protocols for the preparation and multiplexing of samples for amplicon sequencing have been developed. Here, we present two economical high-throughput gene amplification and sequencing workflows that are implemented as standard operating procedures at the Joint Microbiome Facility of the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Vienna. These workflows are based on a previously-published two-step PCR approach, but have been updated to either increase the accuracy of results, or alternatively to achieve orders of magnitude higher numbers of samples to be multiplexed in a single sequencing run. The high-accuracy workflow relies on unique dual sample barcoding. It allows the same level of sample multiplexing as the previously-published two-step PCR approach, but effectively eliminates residual read missasignments between samples (crosstalk) which are inherent to single barcoding approaches. The high-multiplexing workflow is based on combinatorial dual sample barcoding, which theoretically allows for multiplexing up to 299,756 amplicon libraries of the same target gene in a single massively-parallelized amplicon sequencing run. Both workflows presented here are highly economical, easy to implement, and can, without significant modifications or cost, be applied to any target gene of interest.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. CAG repeat length explains around half of the variation in age at onset (AAO) but genetic variation elsewhere in the genome accounts for a significant proportion of the remainder. Genome-wide association studies have identified a bidirectional signal on chromosome 15, likely underlain by FANCD2- and FANCI-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), a nuclease involved in DNA interstrand cross link repair. Here we show that increased FAN1 expression is significantly associated with delayed AAO and slower progression of HD, suggesting FAN1 is protective in the context of an expanded HTT CAG repeat. FAN1 overexpression in human cells reduces CAG repeat expansion in exogenously expressed mutant HTT exon 1, and in patient-derived stem cells and differentiated medium spiny neurons, FAN1 knockdown increases CAG repeat expansion. The stabilizing effects are FAN1 concentration and CAG repeat length-dependent. We show that FAN1 binds to the expanded HTT CAG repeat DNA and its nuclease activity is not required for protection against CAG repeat expansion. These data shed new mechanistic insights into how the genetic modifiers of HD act to alter disease progression and show that FAN1 affects somatic expansion of the CAG repeat through a nuclease-independent mechanism. This provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in HD and potentially other triplet repeat disorders.},

We find CpG-poor promoters hypermethylated in somatic cells, which does not preclude their activity. This methylation is present in male gametes and results in evolutionary loss of CpG dinucleotides, as measured by divergence between humans and primates. In contrast, strong CpG island promoters are mostly unmethylated, even when inactive. Weak CpG island promoters are distinct, as they are preferential targets for de novo methylation in somatic cells. Notably, most germline-specific genes are methylated in somatic cells, suggesting additional functional selection. These results show that promoter sequence and gene function are major predictors of promoter methylation states. Moreover, we observe that inactive unmethylated CpG island promoters show elevated levels of dimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3, suggesting that this chromatin mark may protect DNA from methylation.},

Here, we summarize the current understanding of the distinct DNA methylation landscapes that emerge over the mammalian lifespan and discuss how they interact with other regulatory layers to support diverse genomic functions. We then review the rising interest in alternative patterns found during senescence and the somatic transition to cancer.

To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5\% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to 76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with {\textless}40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28\% to 78\%.

Here, we show a novel epigenetic mark, characterized by strand-specific hemimethylation of contiguous CpG sites affecting the germline DMR of the murine Peg3, but not Snrpn, imprinted domain. This modification is enriched in tetraploid cortical neurons, a cell type where evidence for a small proportion of formylmethylated CpG sites within the Peg3-controlling DMR is also provided. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based transcriptional analysis indicated that these epigenetic modifications participate in the maintainance of the monoallelic expression pattern of the Peg3 imprinted gene. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that the methylation pattern observed in DMRs controlling defined imprinting regions can be modified in somatic cells, resulting in a novel epigenetic modification that gives rise to strand-specific hemimethylated domains functional for genomic imprinting.

Previous identification of hemi-methylation relied on harsh bisulfite treatment, leading to extensive DNA degradation and loss of methylation information. Here we introduce Mhemi-seq, a bisulfite-free strategy, to efficiently resolve methylation status of cytosine dyads into unmethylation, strand-specific hemi-methylation, or full-methylation. Mhemi-seq reproduces methylomes from bisulfite-based sequencing (BS-seq \&amp; hpBS-seq), including the asymmetric hemi-methylation enrichment flanking CTCF motifs. By avoiding base conversion, Mhemi-seq resolves allele-specific methylation and associated imprinted gene expression more efficiently than BS-seq. Furthermore, we reveal an inhibitory role of hemi-methylation in gene expression and transcription factor (TF)–DNA binding, and some displays a similar extent of inhibition as full-methylation. Finally, we uncover new hemi-methylation patterns within Alu retrotransposon elements. Collectively, Mhemi-seq can accelerate the identification of DNA hemi-methylation and facilitate its integration into the chromatin environment for future studies.},

Two short tetrameric short tandem repeats (STRs) with different repeat structures were investigated: D3S1545 containing only homogeneous (GATA)n repeat stretches and D7S1517 with compound repeat arrays of GAAA and CAAA repeats. Additionally two different polymerases (Herculase and AmpliTaq Gold) were used which gave comparable results. No correlation was found for the hypothesis "total repeat number against percent of stutter"; in contrast, the other hypothesis that the number of uniform repeats is relevant for the degree of stutter gave a strong positive correlation (0.82 for selected D7S1517 alleles) which confirmed the hypothesis that polymerase slippage correlates to the length of repeat stretches consisting of uniform repeats.},

These rearrangements can result in either deletion or duplication of genetic material flanked by direct sequence repeats. Molecular genetic analysis of repetitive sequence instability in Escherichia coli has provided several clues to the underlying mechanisms of these rearrangements. We present evidence for three mechanisms of RecA-independent sequence rearrangements: simple replication slippage, sister-chromosome exchange-associated slippage, and single-strand annealing. We discuss the constraints of these mechanisms and contrast their properties with RecA-dependent homologous recombination. Replication plays a critical role in the two slipped misalignment mechanisms, and difficulties in replication appear to trigger rearrangements via all these mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Simple repetitive DNA sequences are a widespread and abundant feature of genomic DNA. The following several features characterize such sequences: (1) they typically consist of a variety of repeated motifs of 1-10 bases--but may include much larger repeats as well; (2) larger repeat units often include shorter ones within them; (3) long polypyrimidine and poly-CA tracts are often found; and (4) tandem arrangements of closely related motifs are often found. We propose that slipped-strand mispairing events, in concert with unequal crossing-over, can readily account for all of these features. The frequent occurrence of long tandem repeats of particular motifs (polypyrimidine and poly-CA tracts) appears to result from nonrandom patterns of nucleotide substitution. We argue that the intrahelical process of slipped-strand mispairing is much more likely to be the major factor in the initial expansion of short repeated motifs and that, after initial expansion, simple tandem repeats may be predisposed to further expansion by unequal crossing-over or other interhelical events because of their propensity to mispair. Evidence is presented that single-base repeats (the shortest possible motifs) are represented by longer runs in mammalian introns than would be expected on a random basis, supporting the idea that SSM may be a ubiquitous force in the evolution of the eukaryotic genome. Simple repetitive sequences may therefore represent a natural ground state of DNA unselected for coding functions.},

First, we show that isoaccepting tRNA gene copy numbers correlate positively with expression-weighted frequencies of amino acids and codons. Using expression data of more than 14,000 human genes, we show a weak positive correlation between gene expression level and frequency of optimal codons (codons with highest tRNA gene copy number). Interestingly, contrary to non-mammalian eukaryotes, codon bias tends to be high in both highly expressed genes and lowly expressed genes. We suggest that selection may act on codon bias, not only to increase elongation rate by favoring optimal codons in highly expressed genes, but also to reduce elongation rate by favoring non-optimal codons in lowly expressed genes. We also show that the frequency of optimal codons is in positive correlation with estimates of protein biosynthetic cost, and suggest another possible action of selection on codon bias: preference of optimal codons as production cost rises, to reduce the rate of amino acid misincorporation. In the analyses of this work, we introduce a new measure of frequency of optimal codons (FOP′), which is unaffected by amino acid composition and is corrected for background nucleotide content; we also introduce a new method for computing expected codon frequencies, based on the dinucleotide composition of the introns and the non-coding regions surrounding a gene.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy are two distinct and interacting proteolytic systems. They play critical roles in cell survival under normal conditions and during stress. An increasing body of evidence indicates that ubiquitinated cargoes are important markers of degradation. p62, a classical receptor of autophagy, is a multifunctional protein located throughout the cell and involved in many signal transduction pathways, including the Keap1–Nrf2 pathway. It is involved in the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. When the cellular p62 level is manipulated, the quantity and location pattern of ubiquitinated proteins change with a considerable impact on cell survival. Altered p62 levels can even lead to some diseases. The proteotoxic stress imposed by proteasome inhibition can activate autophagy through p62 phosphorylation. A deficiency in autophagy may compromise the ubiquitin–proteasome system, since overabundant p62 delays delivery of the proteasomal substrate to the proteasome despite proteasomal catalytic activity being unchanged. In addition, p62 and the proteasome can modulate the activity of HDAC6 deacetylase, thus influencing the autophagic degradation.},

While there is a significant depth of information on DNA damage repair, with many drugs and drug targets, most of this development has taken place in the context of cancer therapy. DNA damage repair in neurons does not rely on DNA replication correction mechanisms. However, there is a strong connection between DNA repair and neuronal metabolism, mediated by nucleotide salvaging and the poly ADP-ribose (PAR) response, and this connection has been implicated in other age-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Validation of leads including the mismatch repair protein MSH3, and interstrand cross-link repair protein FAN1, suggest the mechanism is driven by somatic CAG instability, which is supported by the protective effect of CAA substitutions in the CAG tract. We currently do not understand: how somatic instability is triggered; the state of DNA damage within expanding alleles in the brain; whether this damage induces mismatch repair and interstrand cross-link pathways; whether instability mediates toxicity, and how this relates to human ageing. We discuss DNA damage pathways uncovered by HD GWAS, known roles of other polyglutamine disease proteins in DNA damage repair, and a panel of hypotheses for pathogenic mechanisms.},

In five DM patients, the restriction fragment containing the repeat region was substantially larger in skeletal muscle than in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). In addition, one normal subject showed a size discrepancy in one of the normal alleles by one repeat on the polymerase chain reaction analysis. In most DM patients, the repeat size of native PBL differed from the transformed lymphoblastoid cells after passages. In contrast, various tissues from a congenital DM patient showed a similar size of the expanded repeat, including the transformed lymphoblastoid cells. We conclude that somatic instability of the CTG repeat may cause substantial tissue variability of the CTG repeat size in adult-onset DM, providing a potential mechanism for the variable pleiotropism.},

We then survey alternative DNA structures that are formed by expandable repeats and review the evidence that formation of these structures is at the core of repeat instability. Next, we describe the consequences of the presence of long structure-forming repeats at the molecular level: somatic and intergenerational instability, fragility, and repeat-induced mutagenesis. We discuss the reasons for gender bias in intergenerational repeat instability and the tissue specificity of somatic repeat instability. We also review the known pathways in which DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin state interact and thereby promote repeat instability. We then discuss possible reasons for the persistence of disease-causing DNA repeats in the genome. We describe evidence suggesting that these repeats are a payoff for the advantages of having abundant simple-sequence repeats for eukaryotic genome function and evolvability. Finally, we discuss two unresolved fundamental questions: (i) why does repeat behavior differ between model systems and human pedigrees, and (ii) can we use current knowledge on repeat instability mechanisms to cure repeat expansion diseases?},

In most FXS patients, the FMR1 gene is epigenetically inactivated following the expansion over 200 triplets of a CGG repeat (FM: full mutation). FMR1 encodes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which binds several mRNAs, mainly in the brain. When the FM becomes methylated at 10–12 weeks of gestation, the FMR1 gene is transcriptionally silent. The molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic silencing are not fully elucidated. Among FXS families, there is a rare occurrence of males carrying a FM, which remains active because it is not methylated, thus ensuring enough FMRPs to allow for an intellectual development within normal range. Which mechanisms are responsible for sparing these individuals from being affected by FXS? In order to answer this critical question, which may have possible implications for FXS therapy, several potential epigenetic mechanisms have been described.

We tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the results with conventional molecular methods.For 108 samples, dmTGS achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9\%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P \&lt; 0.01), and detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1\% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5\% for full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients with detailed characterization.dmTGS accurately detects repeat sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.},

Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with highly variable clinical manifestations, making diagnosis challenging. Recent advancements in genetic and pathological testing, such as the identification of GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene, have improved diagnostic accuracy, but familial cases remain underreported.

Patient concerns:
This report details 3 cases of familial adult-onset NIID in 2 sisters and 1 brother. The older sister experienced episodic encephalopathy and autonomic dysfunction for over 40 years, while the younger sister presented similar symptoms 5 years ago. The brother also developed episodic encephalopathy 5 years ago. Brain diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for all 3 patients revealed hyperintensity at the corticomedullary junction and corpus callosum. Skin biopsies from the older sister and brother confirmed the presence of p62 antibody-positive intranuclear inclusion bodies in sweat gland cells and fibroblasts. Genetic testing showed 146 and 133 GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene in the older sister and brother, respectively.

Diagnoses:
All 3 patients were diagnosed with NIID based on clinical, radiological, and genetic findings.

Interventions:
The patients received hormonal therapy, circulation-enhancing treatments, and rehydration therapy during acute episodes.

Outcomes:
All 3 patients showed significant improvement in symptoms following treatment, with a return to baseline function after hospital discharge.

Lessons:
Proper management of NIID includes prompt recognition of symptoms, adequate rest, and avoidance of triggers such as fatigue, infections, and stress, which may reduce the frequency of episodic attacks. Early diagnosis and targeted symptomatic treatment are essential for improving patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of eosinophilic inclusions in the neurons, visceral and skin cells. The cause is associated with the GGC nucleotide repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. The imaging hallmark of NIID is hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at the corticomedullary junction. Clinical manifestations of NIID are highly heterogeneous. Here, we report a case of NIID presenting with acute-onset dementia and cortical edema.

Case presentation
We describe an elderly male patient who presented with sudden dementia within a day. Considering the abrupt onset and the stroke history, we initially diagnosed vascular disease. However, further imaging revealed cortical edema in the temporo-parieto-occipital lobes. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests ruled out immunological, metabolic, infectious, or neoplastic etiologies. Genetic testing ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy did not improve the patient’s symptoms; However, about 1 month after treatment, spontaneous improvement was observed. It is noteworthy that 22 months before the onset of cognitive impairment, the patient’s MRI for headaches already exhibited the typical imaging lesions of this disease in the cerebellum paravermal region.

Conclusion
Patients with encephalopathy syndrome exhibiting imaging features resembling mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease should consider the NIID as differential diagnosis. Chronic headaches and symmetric lesions in the cerebellar paravermal region on MRI may be noteworthy indicators of NIID during non-episodic phases.},

	abstract = {Background
The expansion of GGC repeats (typically exceeding 60 repeats) in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene (N2C) is linked to N2C-related repeat expansion disorders (NREDs), such as neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), essential tremor (ET), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). These disorders share common clinical manifestations, including parkinsonism, dementia, seizures, and muscle weakness. Intermediate repeat sizes ranging from 40 to 60 GGC repeats, particularly those with AGC-encoded serine insertions, have been reported to be associated with PD; however, the functional implications of these intermediate repeats with serine insertion remain unexplored.

Methods
Here, we utilized cellular models harbouring different sizes of N2C variant 2 (N2C2) GGC repeat expansion and CRISPR-Cas9 engineered transgenic mouse models carrying N2C2 GGC intermediate repeats with and without serine insertion to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology associated with N2C intermediate repeat with serine insertion in NREDs.

Results
Our findings revealed that the N2C2 GGC intermediate repeat with serine insertion (32G13S) led to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in vitro. The neurotoxicity was influenced by the length of the repeat and was exacerbated by the presence of the serine insertion. In 12-month-old transgenic mice, 32G13S intensified intranuclear aggregation and exhibited early PD-like characteristics, including the formation of α-synuclein fibers in the midbrain and the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in both the cortex and striatum. Additionally, 32G13S induced neuronal hyperexcitability and caused locomotor behavioural impairments. Transcriptomic analysis of the mouse cortex indicated dysregulation in calcium signaling and MAPK signaling pathways, both of which are critical for mitochondrial function. Notably, genes associated with myelin sheath components, including MBP and MOG, were dysregulated in the 32G13S mouse. Further investigations using immunostaining and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the N2C intermediate repeat with serine induced mitochondrial dysfunction-related hypermyelination in the cortex.

Conclusions
Our in vitro and in vivo investigations provide the first evidence that the N2C-GGC intermediate repeat with serine promotes intranuclear aggregation of N2C, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction-associated hypermyelination and neuronal hyperexcitability. These changes contribute to motor deficits in early PD-like neurodegeneration in NREDs.

The identification of GGC-repeat expansions in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene facilitates the accurate diagnosis of NIID. Due to its rareness and high clinical heterogeneity, the diagnosis of NIID is often delayed or missed. Here, we report a case of NIID mimicking autoimmune encephalitis. A 55-year-old Chinese man presented with fever, headache, recurrent seizures, and weakness in the upper and lower left limbs. Brain MRI revealed diffuse T2/ FLAIR-hyperintense lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and periventricular white matter, with swelling of the right temporal, frontal, and parietal cortices accompanied by meningeal enhancement. Abnormally high signal lesions were observed in the corticomedullary junction in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The infectious or autoimmune disease screening of central nervous system using CSF was normal. The test of GGC-repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene by capillary electrophoresis indicated GGC repeats (48 and 110 GGC repeats), which supported the diagnosis of NIID. After treatment with glucocorticoid, the clinical symptoms of this patient improved significantly. In the literature, 12 cases of NIID presenting with encephalitis-like attacks were identified, most of which were recurrent, accompanied by progressive symptoms such as dementia, Parkinsonism symptoms, migraine, or dysuria. In this case, there was a single encephalitis-like episode without other progressive symptoms. In patients with encephalitis-like symptoms, NIID should be considered, especially when no other evidence of infection is found, as demonstrated in this case. In addition, long-term monitoring of disease progression is also very important.},

Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease with various manifestations and high heterogeneity. Clinical characteristics, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic testing are necessary for its diagnosis. Electromyography may also be a useful tool for diagnosing NIID. In this study, we report a patient with motor and sensory nerve demyelination changes accompanied by axonal damage.

Patient concerns:
A 64-year-old woman was admitted to our department with gradually worsening forgetfulness for over a year. After 6 years of follow-up, the symptoms progressively deteriorated.

Diagnoses:
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed increased protein levels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic “ribbon-like” high signals in the corticomedullary junction area on diffusion-weighted imaging. High-intensity signals in the white matter were also observed on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Electromyography revealed multiple peripheral nerve damage and conduction changes, including motor and sensory nerve demyelination changes, accompanied by axonal damage. Skin biopsy revealed inclusion bodies with strong positive staining for P62 and ubiquitin antibodies in the nuclei of sweat gland cells, adipocytes, and fibroblasts. Genetic testing indicated that the number of GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC alleles were 14 and 134, respectively. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with NIID.

Interventions:
Currently, no effective treatment is available to delay the progression of the disease.

Lessons:
We report a case of NIID with subclinical peripheral neuropathy, although the patient did not experience sensory symptoms such as numbness in the extremities. Electromyography can be used to detect subclinical peripheral nerve damage.},

Herein, we present a case of a patient with NIID who underwent a 10-year brain MRI follow-up study and a literature review. A 78-year-old woman presented with severe cognitive dysfunction and disturbances of consciousness. Her brain MRI DWI signal intensity gradually increased over 10 years, and her cognitive function progressively declined.

Although high DWI signals along the CMJ are specific to NIID, many patients also show high signals on FLAIR in the deep subcortical white matter. In our literature review, dementia could have some correlation to MRI signals. In our case with longitudinal follow up, the DWI high intensity signal expansion could have correlation to cognitive decline. We found dementia and the dementia progression may have some relation to expansion of DWI with intensity signals from the CMJ to the deep subcortical white matter.

However, the distribution of WMLs and their clinical correlations remain poorly understood in NIID. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of WMLs in the brain of patients with NOTCH2NLC-related NIID.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients diagnosed with NOTCH2NLC-related NIID in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University. Detailed clinical information, including retrospective MRI data, was collected. Spatial distribution of WMLs with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities was quantified, and the relationship between WML distribution and clinical presentations was analyzed by the Fisher exact test. The volume of whole-brain WMLs was quantified using ITK-SNAP software. The relationship between phenotypes and WML volume was analyzed by the Student t test, Mann-Whitney test, or correlation analysis. WML development patterns were summarized based on the longitudinal observation of MRI characteristics.
RESULTS: This study evaluated 45 patients with NOTCH2NLC-related NIID, with a median age of 66 years (range 55-82 years) and consisting of 30 women. Patients exhibited diverse clinical manifestations, with cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction, and tremor being the 3 most frequent presentations. Severe WMLs were observed in 43 patients, with FLAIR hyperintensities predominantly in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale, and other brain regions. The presence of DWI hyperintensities was common in the corticomedullary junction (91.1\%) and corpus callosum (53.3\%). Analysis showed significant correlations between FLAIR hyperintensity volume and both age (r = 0.312, p = 0.042) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = -0.371, p = 0.048). Longitudinal MRI retrospection in 7 patients over an average of 9.6 ± 2.9 years revealed 3 gradually progressed WML patterns: periventricular-subcortical, periventricular-dominant, and corticomedullary junction-dominant. In addition, 3 patients experienced rapid WML expansion associated with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke (MELAS)-like episodes.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis revealed the radiologic characteristics and spatial distribution of WMLs and demonstrated significant correlations between FLAIR hyperintensity volume and age/cognitive levels in NIID. Long-term retrospection revealed 3 types of gradual WML expansion patterns while MELAS-like episodes cause rapid WML aggravation. Although results should be confirmed in a larger cohort, these insights enhance understanding of NIID's clinical-radiologic relationships and pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of inclusions within the nuclei of various cell types. The clinical manifestations of patients with NIID are diverse. Here, we present the case of a patient with NIID whose clinical presentation and magnetic resonance features closely resembled those of hydrocephalus.

Case presentation
The patient was 71-year-old woman with no significant family history. Seven years previously, she began to experience tremors in both hands, which occurred at rest and while holding objects; this was accompanied by urinary incontinence. Four years previously, she developed weakness in both lower limbs, an unstable gait, and dizziness. Over the past year, she noticed stiffening at the root of her tongue, cognitive decline, and slower reaction times compared to her previous state. Upon admission, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hydrocephalus-like changes. A cerebrospinal fluid drainage test returned negative results. The patient presented with tremors and urinary incontinence. Physical examination indicated pupillary constriction, and electromyography suggested peripheral neuropathy. Genetic testing revealed 91 GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene, indicating abnormal expansion. The final diagnosis was NIID. We provided symptomatic treatment for the tremor and cognitive impairment, but there was no significant improvement in the clinical symptoms.

Conclusions
Our case suggests that when a patient presents with clinical symptoms and MRI findings resembling hydrocephalus, the possibility of NIID should be considered, especially in the presence of tremors and autonomic symptoms.},

	abstract = {Background
Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is genetically linked to CGG repeat expansion in the 5’-untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene, with nascent polyglycine-containing protein (uN2CpolyG) identified as a primary pathogenic factor. Emerging clinical evidence suggests that inflammation contributes to NIID pathogenesis, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular interaction between uN2CpolyG and the NF-κB-NLRP3 pathway.

Methods
Single-cell RNA sequencing was conducted on the skin tissues of NIID patients to assess changes in the expression of genes involved in inflammatory pathways. Cell models (HEK-293T and U87-MG) transfected with CGG9/69/100 expansion vectors were used to investigate alterations in the NF-κB-NLRP3-autophagy pathway. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of NF-κB activators was evaluated in a Drosophila model with a CGG expansion knock-in.

Results
Single-cell sequencing revealed a significant reduction in the expression of NFKBIA, encoding NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IkBa), which facilitates the nuclear translocation of p65, a key NF-κB component. uN2CpolyG directly interacted with and sequestered p65 in nuclear inclusions, leading to reduced phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) levels. This sequestration significantly downregulated the NF-κB-NLRP3 pathway, impairing autophagy, as indicated by decreased LC3II/LC3I ratios. Treatment of CGG100 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased p-p65, NLRP3, and LC3II/LC3I levels while reducing insoluble uN2CpolyG levels and intranuclear inclusions. In the Drosophila knock-in model, LPS significantly reduced the number of intranuclear inclusions and improved phenotypic manifestations.

Conclusions
This study revealed that uN2CpolyG directly interacts with and sequesters p65, thereby inhibiting the NF-κB-NLRP3 pathway and impairing autophagy. This mechanism highlights a novel therapeutic target for NIID and provides potentially broader insights into similar mechanisms in other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by misfolded protein aggregates.

	abstract = {The CGG repeat expansions in the 5’-UTR regions of certain genes have been implicated in various neurodegenerative and muscular disorders. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we explore the role of the small molecular chaperone HSPB1 in counteracting neurodegeneration induced by poly-glycine (poly-G) aggregates. Employing a reporter system, we demonstrate that CGG repeat expansions within the 5’-UTR of the GIPC1 gene produce poly-G proteins, by repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Through proximity labeling and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, we characterize the composition of poly-G insoluble aggregates and reveal that these aggregates sequester key macroautophagy/autophagy receptors, SQSTM1/p62 and TOLLIP. This sequestration disrupts MAP1LC3/LC3 recruitment and impairs autophagosome formation, thereby compromising the autophagic pathway. Importantly, we show that HSPB1 facilitates the dissociation of these receptors from poly-G aggregates and consequently restores autophagic function. Overexpressing HSPB1 alleviates poly-G-induced neurodegeneration in mouse models. Taken together, these findings highlight a mechanistic basis for the neuroprotective effects of HSPB1 and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in treating poly-G-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

	abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is one of a growing number of inherited human diseases whose molecular basis has been implicated as the expansion of a trinucleotide DNA repeat. Expanded disease-associated alleles of \&gt;50 CTG repeats are unstable in both the germline and soma. Expansion of the unstable alleles over time and variation of the level of mutation between the somatic tissues of an individual are thought to account at least partially for the tissue specificity and progressive nature of the symptoms. We previously generated a number of transgenic mouse lines containing a large expanded CTG repeat tract that replicated a number of the features of unstable DNA in humans, including frequent sex-specific changes in allele length during intergenerational transmission. Small length change mutations were apparent in the somatic tissues of young mice in all of the lines generated, but the gross instability observed in human DM1 patients was not replicated. We now show that in one of the lines, Dmt-D, spectacular, expansion-biased, tissue-specific instability is observed in older mice. The highest levels of instability were detected in kidney with gains of \&gt;500 repeats, representing a tripling of allele length, in some cells. Mosaicism accumulated in an age-dependent manner, but the tissue specificity did not obviously correlate with cell turnover. Such gross somatic mosaicism was not observed in three other lines examined, further emphasizing a role for flanking DNA in modulating repeat stability.},

To investigate the underlying mechanisms of repeat instability, which occurs both somatically and intergenerationally, we created a novel mouse model of familial ALS/FTD that harbors 96 copies of G4C2 repeats at a humanized C9orf72 locus. In mouse embryonic stem cells, we observed two modes of repeat expansion. First, we noted minor increases in repeat length per expansion event, which was dependent on a mismatch repair pathway protein Msh2. Second, we found major increases in repeat length per event when a DNA double- or single-strand break (DSB/SSB) was artificially introduced proximal to the repeats, and which was dependent on the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. In mice, the first mode primarily drove somatic repeat expansion. Major changes in repeat length, including expansion, were observed when SSB was introduced in one-cell embryos, or intergenerationally without DSB/SSB introduction if G4C2 repeats exceeded 400 copies, although spontaneous HDR-mediated expansion has yet to be identified. These findings provide a novel strategy to model repeat expansion in a non-human genome and offer insights into the mechanism behind C9orf72 G4C2 repeat instability.},

Because iPSCs provide an unlimited source of cells and can be obtained from large numbers of HD patients, they are a uniquely valuable tool for investigating disease mechanisms and for discovering potential disease-modifying therapeutics. Here, we summarize some of the important findings in HD pathophysiology that have emerged from studies of patient-derived iPSC lines. Because they retain the genome and actual disease mutations of the patient, they provide a cell source to investigate genetic contributions to the disease. iPSCs provide advantages over other disease models. While iPSC-based technology erases some epigenetic marks, newly developed transdifferentiation methods now let us investigate epigenetic factors that control expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT). Human HD iPSC lines allow us to investigate how endogenous levels of mHTT affect cell health, in contrast to other models that often rely on overexpressing the protein. iPSCs can be differentiated into neurons and other disease-related cells such as astrocytes from different brain regions to study brain regional differences in the disease process, as well as the cell-cell dependencies involved in HD-associated neurodegeneration. They also serve as a tissue source to investigate factors that impact CAG repeat instability, which is involved in regional differences in neurodegeneration in the HD brain. Human iPSC models can serve as a powerful model system to identify genetic modifiers that may impact disease onset, progression, and symptomatology, providing novel molecular targets for drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by transcriptional silencing of the frataxin gene (FXN) due to expansions of GAA repeats in intron 1. FRDA manifests with multiple symptoms, which may include ataxia, cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Expanded GAA tracts are genetically unstable, exhibiting both expansions and contractions. GAA length correlates with severity of FRDA symptoms and inversely with age of onset. Thus, tissue-specific somatic instability of long GAA repeats may be implicated in the development of symptoms and disease progression. Herein, we determined the extent of somatic instability of the GAA repeats in heart, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, cerebellar cortex, and pancreatic tissues from 15 FRDA patients. Results demonstrate differences in the lengths of the expanded GAAs among different tissues, with significantly longer GAA tracts detected in heart and pancreas than in other tissues. The expansion bias detected in heart and pancreas may contribute to disease onset and progression, making the mechanism of somatic instability an important target for therapy. Additionally, we detected significant differences in GAA tract lengths between lymphocytes and fibroblast pairs derived from 16 FRDA patients, with longer GAA tracts present in the lymphocytes. This result urges caution in direct comparisons of data obtained in these frequently used FRDA models. Furthermore, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of the GAA repeat length in lymphocytes collected over a span of 7–9 years and demonstrated progressive expansions of the GAAs with maximum gain of approximately 9 repeats per year. Continuous GAA expansions throughout the patient’s lifespan, as observed in FRDA lymphocytes, should be considered in clinical trial designs and data interpretation.},

Mutant HTT (mHTT) disrupts transcription, interferes with immune and mitochondrial function, and is aberrantly modified post-translationally. Evidence suggests that the mHTT RNA is toxic, and at the DNA level, somatic CAG repeat expansion in vulnerable cells influences the disease course. Genome-wide association studies have identified DNA repair pathways as modifiers of somatic instability and disease course in HD and other repeat expansion diseases. In animal models of HD, nucleocytoplasmic transport is disrupted and its restoration is neuroprotective. Novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers are among the earliest detectable changes in individuals with premanifest HD and have the sensitivity to detect therapeutic benefit. Therapeutically, the first human trial of an HTT-lowering antisense oligonucleotide successfully, and safely, reduced the CSF concentration of mHTT in individuals with HD. A larger trial, powered to detect clinical efficacy, is underway, along with trials of other HTT-lowering approaches. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of HD and future therapeutic strategies, including the modulation of DNA repair and targeting the DNA mutation itself.},

These diseases are all characterised by neurological symptoms and central neurodegeneration, but our understanding of how expanded repeats drive neuronal loss is incomplete. Recent human genetic evidence implicates DNA repair pathways, especially mismatch repair, in modifying the onset and progression of CAG repeat diseases. Repair pathways might operate directly on repeat sequences by licensing or inhibiting repeat expansion in neurons. Alternatively, or in addition, because many of the genes containing pathogenic CAG repeats encode proteins that themselves have roles in the DNA damage response, it is possible that repeat expansions impair specific DNA repair pathways. DNA damage could then accrue in neurons, leading to further expansion at repeat loci, thus setting up a vicious cycle of pathology. In this review, we consider DNA damage and repair pathways in postmitotic neurons in the context of disease-causing CAG repeats. Investigating and understanding these pathways, which are clearly relevant in promoting and ameliorating disease in humans, is a research priority, as they are known to modify disease and therefore constitute prevalidated drug targets.},

We report here clinicopathological findings of a 25-year-old female patient who died after 13 years of a clinical course characterized by progressive gait disturbance and movement disorders. Histological examination revealed widespread NIs with neuronal loss in restricted regions; neuronal loss was severe in the subthalamic nucleus, internal pallidum, substantia nigra, Edinger-Westphal nucleus and Purkinje cell layer. Quantification of the NIs combined with a graded evaluation of neuronal loss revealed an overall tendency for more severe neuronal loss to be accompanied by a lower frequency of NIs. A morphological similarity to the nuclear inclusions recently identified in several CAG repeat diseases prompted us to examine the immunolocalization of ubiquitin and expanded polyglutamine stretches, which demonstrated the presence of ubiquitin at the periphery of most NIs. An expanded polyglutamine stretch was seen in the center of limited number of NIs. These findings indicate that abnormal fragments such as expanded polyglutamine regions are incorporated into the inclusion, aggregated in its center, and thereby metabolized by a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. Although it remains to be elucidated how the formation of NIs is related to neuronal degeneration, our findings suggest that NIs are formed in the process of sequestering or degrading abnormal protein fragments and formation of NIs may not be immediately toxic to neurons.},

	abstract = {The Pacific region provides unique opportunities to study human evolution including through analyses of ancient DNA. While some of the earliest studies involving ancient DNA from skeletal remains focused on Pacific samples, in the following 25 years, several factors meant that little aDNA research, particularly research focused on human populations, has emerged. This paper briefly presents the genetic evidence for population origins, reviews what ancient DNA work has been undertaken to address human history and evolution in the Pacific region, and argues that the future is bright but research requires a collaborative approach between academic disciplines but also with local communities.},

	abstract = {Parkinson\&apos;s disease (PD) is clinically, pathologically, and genetically heterogeneous, resisting distillation to a single, cohesive disorder. Instead, each affected individual develops a virtually unique form of Parkinson\&apos;s syndrome. Clinical manifestations consist of variable motor and nonmotor features, and myriad overlaps are recognized with other neurodegenerative conditions. Although most commonly characterized by alpha-synuclein protein pathology throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, the distribution varies and other pathologies commonly modify PD or trigger similar manifestations. Nearly all PD is genetically influenced. More than 100 genes or genetic loci have been identified, and most cases likely arise from interactions among many common and rare genetic variants. Despite its complex architecture, insights from experimental genetic dissection coalesce to reveal unifying biological themes, including synaptic, lysosomal, mitochondrial, andimmune-mediated mechanisms of pathogenesis. This emerging understanding of Parkinson\&apos;s syndrome, coupled with advances in biomarkers and targeted therapies, presages successful precision medicine strategies.},

It is therefore vital to project the epidemiologic trend of ALS. To date, there have been few published studies attempting to estimate the number and distribution of ALS cases in the upcoming years. Here we show that the number of ALS cases across the globe will increase from 222,801 in 2015 to 376,674 in 2040, representing an increase of 69\%. This increase is predominantly due to ageing of the population, particularly among developing nations. This projection is likely an underestimate due to improving healthcare and economic conditions. The results should be used to inform healthcare policy to more efficiently allocate healthcare resources.},

	abstract = {NOTCH2NL (NOTCH2-N-terminus-like) genes arose from incomplete, recent chromosome 1 segmental duplications implicated in human brain cortical expansion. Genetic characterization of these loci and their regulation is complicated by the fact they are embedded in large, nearly identical duplications that predispose to recurrent microdeletion syndromes. Using nearly complete long-read assemblies generated from 67 human and 12 ape haploid genomes, we show independent recurrent duplication among apes with functional copies emerging in humans {\textasciitilde}2.1 million years ago. We distinguish NOTCH2NL paralogs present in every human haplotype (NOTCH2NLA) from copy number variable ones. We also characterize large-scale structural variation, including gene conversion, for 28\% of haplotypes leading to a previously undescribed paralog, NOTCH2tv. Finally, we apply Fiber-seq and long-read transcript sequencing to human cortical neurospheres to characterize the regulatory landscape and find that the most fixed paralogs, NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NLA, harbor the greatest number of paralog-specific elements potentially driving their regulation.},

	abstract = {Nucleotide-repeat expansions underlie a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders for which there are currently no effective therapies. Recently, it was discovered that such repetitive RNA motifs can support translation initiation in the absence of an AUG start codon across a wide variety of sequence contexts, and that the products of these atypical translation initiation events contribute to neuronal toxicity. This review examines what we currently know and do not know about repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation in the context of established canonical and non-canonical mechanisms of translation initiation. We highlight recent findings related to RAN translation in three repeat expansion disorders: CGG repeats in fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), GGGGCC repeats in C9orf72 associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and CAG repeats in Huntington disease. These studies suggest that mechanistic differences may exist for RAN translation dependent on repeat type, repeat reading frame, and the surrounding sequence context, but that for at least some repeats, RAN translation retains a dependence on some of the canonical translational initiation machinery.

	abstract = {In each round of translation elongation, the ribosome translocates along the mRNA by precisely one codon. Translocation is promoted by elongation factor G (EF-G) in bacteria (eEF2 in eukaryotes) and entails a number of precisely-timed large-scale structural rearrangements. As a rule, the movements of the ribosome, tRNAs, mRNA and EF-G are orchestrated to maintain the exact codon-wise step size. However, signals in the mRNA, as well as environmental cues, can change the timing and dynamics of the key rearrangements leading to recoding of the mRNA into production of trans-frame peptides from the same mRNA. In this review, we discuss recent advances on the mechanics of translocation and reading frame maintenance. Furthermore, we describe the mechanisms and biological relevance of non-canonical translocation pathways, such as hungry and programmed frameshifting and translational bypassing, and their link to disease and infection.},

However, a number of genetic elements have been described that can induce ribosomes to shift on mRNAs, the most well understood of which are a class that directs ribosomal slippage by one base in 5' (‐1) direction. This is referred to as programmed ‐1 ribosomal frameshifting (‐1 PRF). Recently, a new ‐1 PRF promoting element was serendipitously discovered in a study examining the effects of stretches of adenosines in the coding sequences of mRNAs. Here, we discuss this finding, recent studies describing how ‐1 PRF is used to control gene expression in eukaryotes, and how ‐1 PRF is itself regulated. The implications of dysregulation of ‐1 PRF on human health are examined, as are possible new areas in which novel ‐1 PRF promoting elements might be discovered., Also watch the https://youtu.be/1mPXIINCRcY., A) Traditional ‐1 PRF: ribosomes paused by mRNA structures shift on slippery sites.

	abstract = {Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of 55–200 CGG repeats in the 5′-UTR of the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is characterized by action tremor, gait ataxia and impaired executive cognitive functioning. It has been proposed that FXTAS is caused by titration of RNA-binding proteins by the expanded CGG repeats. Sam68 is an RNA-binding protein involved in alternative splicing regulation and its ablation in mouse leads to motor coordination defects. Here, we report that mRNAs containing expanded CGG repeats form large and dynamic intranuclear RNA aggregates that recruit several RNA-binding proteins sequentially, first Sam68, then hnRNP-G and MBNL1. Importantly, Sam68 is sequestered by expanded CGG repeats and thereby loses its splicing-regulatory function. Consequently, Sam68-responsive splicing is altered in FXTAS patients. Finally, we found that regulation of Sam68 tyrosine phosphorylation modulates its localization within CGG aggregates and that tautomycin prevents both Sam68 and CGG RNA aggregate formation. Overall, these data support an RNA gain-of-function mechanism for FXTAS neuropathology, and suggest possible target routes for treatment options.},

Previously, we showed that microsatellite expansion mutations can be bidirectionally transcribed and that these mutations express unexpected proteins by a unique mechanism, repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. In this study, we show that C9ORF72 antisense transcripts are elevated in the brains of C9ORF72 expansion-positive [C9(+)] patients, and antisense GGCCCC (G2C4) repeat-expansion RNAs accumulate in nuclear foci in brain. Additionally, sense and antisense foci accumulate in blood and are potential biomarkers of the disease. Furthermore, we show that RAN translation occurs from both sense and antisense expansion transcripts, resulting in the expression of six RAN proteins (antisense: Pro-Arg, Pro-Ala, Gly-Pro; and sense: Gly-Ala, Gly-Arg, Gly-Pro). These proteins accumulate in cytoplasmic aggregates in affected brain regions, including the frontal and motor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord neurons, with some brain regions showing dramatic RAN protein accumulation and clustering. The finding that unique antisense G2C4 RNA foci and three unique antisense RAN proteins accumulate in patient tissues indicates that bidirectional transcription of expanded alleles is a fundamental pathologic feature of C9ORF72 ALS/FTD. Additionally, these findings suggest the need to test therapeutic strategies that target both sense and antisense RNAs and RAN proteins in C9ORF72 ALS/FTD, and to more broadly consider the role of antisense expression and RAN translation across microsatellite expansion diseases.},

	abstract = {GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9ORF72 represent the most common genetic variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. We and others have proposed that RNA transcribed from the repeat sequence is toxic via sequestration of RNA-binding factors. Both GGGGCC-repeat (sense) and CCCCGG-repeat (antisense) molecules are detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridisation as RNA foci, but their relative expression pattern within the CNS and contribution to disease has not been determined. Blinded examination of CNS biosamples from ALS patients with a repeat expansion of C9ORF72 showed that antisense foci are present at a significantly higher frequency in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and motor neurons, whereas sense foci are present at a significantly higher frequency in cerebellar granule neurons. Consistent with this, inclusions containing sense or antisense derived dipeptide repeat proteins were present at significantly higher frequency in cerebellar granule neurons or motor neurons, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and UV-crosslinking studies showed that sense and antisense RNA molecules share similar interactions with SRSF2, hnRNP K, hnRNP A1, ALYREF, and hnRNP H/F. Together these data suggest that, although sense and antisense RNA molecules might be expected to be equally toxic via their shared protein binding partners, distinct patterns of expression in various CNS neuronal populations could lead to relative differences in their contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronal injury. Moreover in motor neurons, which are the primary target of pathology in ALS, the presence of antisense foci (χ2, p {\textless} 0.00001) but not sense foci (χ2, p = 0.75) correlated with mislocalisation of TDP-43, which is the hallmark of ALS neurodegeneration. This has implications for translational approaches to C9ORF72 disease, and furthermore interacting RNA-processing factors and transcriptional activators responsible for antisense versus sense transcription might represent novel therapeutic targets.},

Anticipation in this syndrome is associated with progressive amplification of the (CGG)n repeat from a premutation to a full mutation through consecutive generations. Remarkably, expansion of the premutation to the full mutation is strictly maternal. To clarify this parental influence we studied FMR–1 in sperm of four male fragile X patients. This showed that only the premutation was present in their sperm, although they had a full mutation in peripheral lymphocytes. This might suggest that expansion of the premutation to the full mutation in FMR–1 does not occur in meiosis but in a postzygotic stage.},

As a consequence, attempts to express these prime-candidate genes for prophylactic vaccination against papillomavirus-associated diseases in mammalian cells by means of simple DNA transfections result in insufficient production of the viral antigens. Similarly, in vivo DNA vaccination using HPV L1 or L2 expression constructs produces only weak immune responses. In this study we demonstrate that transient expression of the HPV type 16 L1 and L2 proteins can be highly improved by changing the RNA coding sequence, resulting in the accumulation of significant amounts of virus-like particles in the nuclei of transfected cells. Data presented indicate that, in the case of L1, adaptation for codon usage accounts for the vast majority of the improvement in protein expression, whereas translation-independent posttranscriptional events contribute only to a minor degree. Finally, the adapted L1 genes demonstrate strongly increased immunogenicity in vivo compared to that of unmodified L1 genes.},

We examined tRNA gene copy number variation (tgCNV) in six individuals; two kindreds of two parents and a child, using high coverage whole genome sequence data. Such differences may be important because translation of some mRNAs is sensitive to the relative amounts of tRNAs and because tRNA competition determines translational efficiency vs. fidelity and production of native vs. misfolded proteins. We identified several tRNA gene clusters with CNV, which in some cases were part of larger iterations. In addition there was an isolated tRNALysCUU gene that was absent as a homozygous deletion in one of the parents. When assessed by semiquantitative PCR in 98 DNA samples representing a wide variety of ethnicities, this allele was found deleted in hetero- or homozygosity in all groups at {\textasciitilde}50\% frequency. This is the first report of copy number variation of human tRNA genes. We conclude that tgCNV exists at significant levels among individual humans and discuss the results in terms of genetic diversity and prior genome wide association studies (GWAS) that suggest the importance of the ratio of tRNALys isoacceptors in Type-2 diabetes.},

Here we capitalize on the sequencing data from the 1000-genomes project to examine the diversity of tRNA genes in the human population. Previous analysis of the reference human genome indicated an unexpected large number of diverse tRNA genes beyond the necessity of translation, suggesting that some tRNA transcripts may perform non-canonical functions. We found 24 new tRNA sequences in {\textgreater} 1\% and 76 new tRNA sequences in {\textgreater} 0.2\% of all individuals, indicating that tRNA genes are also subject to evolutionary changes in the human population. Unexpectedly, two abundant new tRNA genes contain base-pair mismatches in the anticodon stem. We experimentally determined that these two new tRNAs have altered structures in vitro; however, one new tRNA is not aminoacylated but extremely stable in HeLa cells, suggesting that this new tRNA can be used for non-canonical function. Our results show that at the scale of human population, tRNA genes are more diverse than conventionally understood, and some new tRNAs may perform non-canonical, extra-translational functions that may be linked to human health and disease.},

Recently, the mRNA targets of dozens of RNA-binding proteins have been identified, facilitating a systematic study of the features of target transcripts. Using these data, we demonstrate that calculating the predicted structural accessibility of a putative RBP binding site allows one to significantly improve the accuracy of predicting in vivo binding for the majority of sequence-specific RBPs. In our new in silico approach, accessibility is predicted based solely on the mRNA sequence without consideration of the locations of bound trans-factors; as such, our results suggest a greater than previously anticipated role for intrinsic mRNA secondary structure in determining RBP binding target preference. Target site accessibility aids in predicting target transcripts and the binding sites for RBPs with a range of RNA-binding domains and subcellular functions. Based on this work, we introduce a new motif-finding algorithm that identifies accessible sequence-specific RBP motifs from in vivo binding data.},

	abstract = {RNA–protein interactions differ from DNA–protein interactions because of the central role of RNA secondary structure. Some RNA-binding domains (RBDs) recognize their target sites mainly by their shape and geometry and others are sequence-specific but are sensitive to secondary structure context. A number of small- and large-scale experimental approaches have been developed to measure RNAs associated in vitro and in vivo with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Generalizing outside of the experimental conditions tested by these assays requires computational motif finding. Often RBP motif finding is done by adapting DNA motif finding methods; but modeling secondary structure context leads to better recovery of RBP-binding preferences. Genome-wide assessment of mRNA secondary structure has recently become possible, but these data must be combined with computational predictions of secondary structure before they add value in predicting in vivo binding. There are two main approaches to incorporating structural information into motif models: supplementing primary sequence motif models with preferred secondary structure contexts (e.g., MEMERIS and RNAcontext) and directly modeling secondary structure recognized by the RBP using stochastic context-free grammars (e.g., CMfinder and RNApromo). The former better reconstruct known binding preferences for sequence-specific RBPs but are not suitable for modeling RBPs that recognize shape and geometry of RNAs. Future work in RBP motif finding should incorporate interactions between multiple RBDs and multiple RBPs in binding to RNA.

The repeat nucleotide sequences, their location within the genes, the ranges of normal and disease-causing repeat length and the clinical outcomes differ. Unstable repeats can be located in the coding or the non-coding region of a gene. Different pathogenic mechanisms that are hypothesised to underlie the diseases are discussed. Evidence is given both from studies in simple model systems and from studies on human material and in animal models. Since somatic instability might affect the clinical outcome, this is briefly touched on. Available data and theories on the timing and mechanisms of the repeat instability itself are discussed, along with factors that have been observed to affect instability. Finally, the question of why the often harmful unstable repeats have been maintained throughout evolution is addressed.},

	abstract = {Microsatellites are abundant in eukaryotic genomes and have high rates of strand slippage-induced repeat number alterations. They are popular genetic markers, and their mutations are associated with numerous neurological diseases. However, the minimal number of repeats required to constitute a microsatellite has been debated, and a definition of a microsatellite that considers its mutational behavior has been lacking. To define a microsatellite, we investigated slippage dynamics for a range of repeat sizes, utilizing two approaches. Computationally, we assessed length polymorphism at repeat loci in ten ENCODE regions resequenced in four human populations, assuming that the occurrence of polymorphism reflects strand slippage rates. Experimentally, we determined the in vitro DNA polymerase-mediated strand slippage error rates as a function of repeat number. In both approaches, we compared strand slippage rates at tandem repeats with the background slippage rates. We observed two distinct modes of mutational behavior. At small repeat numbers, slippage rates were low and indistinguishable from background measurements. A marked transition in mutability was observed as the repeat array lengthened, such that slippage rates at large repeat numbers were significantly higher than the background rates. For both mononucleotide and dinucleotide microsatellites studied, the transition length corresponded to a similar number of nucleotides (approximately 10). Thus, microsatellite threshold is determined not by the presence/absence of strand slippage at repeats but by an abrupt alteration in slippage rates relative to background. These findings have implications for understanding microsatellite mutagenesis, standardization of genome-wide microsatellite analyses, and predicting polymorphism levels of individual microsatellite loci.},

	abstract = {Although replication repair deficiency, either by mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) and/or loss of DNA polymerase proofreading, can cause hypermutation in cancer, microsatellite instability (MSI) is considered a hallmark of MMRD alone. By genome-wide analysis of tumors with germline and somatic deficiencies in replication repair, we reveal a novel association between loss of polymerase proofreading and MSI, especially when both components are lost. Analysis of indels in microsatellites (MS-indels) identified five distinct signatures (MS-sigs). MMRD MS-sigs are dominated by multibase losses, whereas mutant-polymerase MS-sigs contain primarily single-base gains. MS deletions in MMRD tumors depend on the original size of the MS and converge to a preferred length, providing mechanistic insight. Finally, we demonstrate that MS-sigs can be a powerful clinical tool for managing individuals with germline MMRD and replication repair–deficient cancers, as they can detect the replication repair deficiency in normal cells and predict their response to immunotherapy.Exome- and genome-wide MSI analysis reveals novel signatures that are uniquely attributed to mismatch repair and DNA polymerase. This provides new mechanistic insight into MS maintenance and can be applied clinically for diagnosis of replication repair deficiency and immunotherapy response prediction.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995},

	abstract = {Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) is caused by the biallelic inactivation of an MMR gene, which can be attributed either to an inherited or an acquired pathway. MMRd is characterized by the inability of cells to repair spontaneous mutations in microsatellites that occur during replication. Microsatellites are repetitive nucleotide sequences composed of one to six base pairs. Mutations in microsatellites lead to deletions or insertions of sequence units that are designated as microsatellite instability (MSI). MMRd is diagnosed by immunochemistry and is characterized by loss of nuclear immunostaining for at least one of the four MMR proteins that are routinely examined, i.e., MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2. Available tests for MSI are PCR and next generation sequencing. MMRd and MSI predispose to tumor initiation and progression, increase tumor mutational burden as well as tumor immunogenicity, facilitate the activation of the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint pathway and serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers in solid tumors.},

Most satellite DNA repeat units are either of nucleosomal length or 5–10 bp long and occupy centromeric, pericentromeric or telomeric regions. Due to high repetitiveness, satellite DNA sequences have largely been absent from genome assemblies. Although few conserved satellite-specific sequence motifs have been identified, DNA curvature, dyad symmetries and inverted repeats are features of various satellite DNAs in several organisms. Satellite DNA sequences are either embedded in highly compact gene-poor heterochromatin or specialized chromatin that is distinct from euchromatin. Nevertheless, some satellite DNAs are transcribed into non-coding RNAs that may play important roles in satellite DNA function. Intriguingly, satellite DNAs are among the most rapidly evolving genomic elements, such that a large fraction is species-specific in most organisms. Here we describe the different classes of satellite DNA sequences, their satellite-specific chromatin features, and how these features may contribute to satellite DNA biology and evolution. We also discuss how the evolution of functional satellite DNA classes may contribute to speciation in plants and animals.},

Furthermore, DNA replication, repair and recombination are implicated in the formation of repeat expansions, as shown in various experimental systems.

Expansion of a subset of these repeat tracts underlies over fifty human disorders, including common genetic causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (C9orf72), polyglutamine-associated ataxias and Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and intellectual disability disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. In this Review, we discuss the four major mechanisms by which expansion of short tandem repeats causes disease: loss of function through transcription repression, RNA-mediated gain of function through gelation and sequestration of RNA-binding proteins, gain of function of canonically translated repeat-harbouring proteins, and repeat-associated non-AUG translation of toxic repeat peptides. Somatic repeat instability amplifies these mechanisms and influences both disease age of onset and tissue specificity of pathogenic features. We focus on the crosstalk between these disease mechanisms, and argue that they often synergize to drive pathogenesis. We also discuss the emerging native functions of repeat elements and how their dynamics might contribute to disease at a larger scale than currently appreciated. Lastly, we propose that lynchpins tying these disease mechanisms and native functions together offer promising therapeutic targets with potential shared applications across this class of human disorders.},

We report here that faulty processing by FEN-1 initiates repeat instability in mammalian cells. Disease-length CAG tracts in Huntington's disease mice heterozygous for FEN-1 display a tendency toward expansions over contractions during intergenerational inheritance compared to those in homozygous wild-type mice. Further, with regard to human cells expressing a nuclease-defective FEN-1, we provide direct evidence that an unprocessed FEN-1 substrate is a precursor to instability. In cells with no endogenous defects in DNA repair, exogenous nuclease-defective FEN-1 causes repeat instability and aberrant DNA repair. Inefficient flap processing blocks the formation of Rad51/BRCA1 complexes but invokes repair by other pathways.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent genetic evidence indicates that null mutants of the 5′-flap endonuclease (FEN1) result in an expansion of repetitive sequences. The substrate for FEN1 is a flap formed by natural 5′-end displacement of the short intermediates of lagging strand replication. FEN1 binds the 5′-end of the flap, tracks to the point of annealing at the base of the flap, and then cleaves. Here we examine mechanisms by which foldback structures within the flap could contribute to repeat expansions. Cleavage by FEN1 was reduced with increased length of the foldback. However, even the longest foldbacks were cleaved at a low rate. Substrates containing the repetitive sequence CTG also were cleaved at a reduced rate. Bubble substrates, likely intermediates in repeat expansions, were inhibitory. Neither replication protein A nor proliferating cell nuclear antigen were able to assist in the removal of secondary structure within a flap. We propose that FEN1 cleaves natural foldbacks at a reduced rate. However, although the cleavage delay is not likely to influence the overall process of chromosomal replication, specific foldbacks could inhibit cleavage sufficiently to result in duplication of the foldback sequence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This review will discuss the various cis-elements that contribute to repeat instability, primarily through examination of the most abundant disease-associated repetitive element, trinucleotide repeats. For the purpose of this review, we define cis-elements to include the sequence of the repeat units, the length and purity of the repeat tracts, the sequences flanking the repeat, as well as the surrounding epigenetic environment, including DNA methylation and chromatin structure. Gender-, tissue-, developmental- and locus-specific cis-elements in conjunction with trans-factors may facilitate instability through the processes of DNA replication, repair and/or recombination. Here we review the available human data that supports the involvement of cis-elements in repeat instability with limited reference to model systems. In diverse tissues at different developmental times and at specific loci, repetitive elements display variable levels of instability, suggesting vastly different mechanisms may be responsible for repeat instability amongst the disease loci and between various tissues.

Inherited CAG repeat length is the primary determinant of age of onset, with human genetic studies underscoring that the disease is driven by the CAG length-dependent propensity of the repeat to further expand in the brain3–9. Routes to slowing somatic CAG expansion, therefore, hold promise for disease-modifying therapies. Several DNA repair genes, notably in the mismatch repair pathway, modify somatic expansion in Huntington’s disease mouse models10. To identify novel modifiers of somatic expansion, we used CRISPR–Cas9 editing in Huntington’s disease knock-in mice to enable in vivo screening of expansion-modifier candidates at scale. This included testing of Huntington’s disease onset modifier genes emerging from human genome-wide association studies as well as interactions between modifier genes, providing insight into pathways underlying CAG expansion and potential therapeutic targets.},

Genetic deficiencies, copy number variants, and single nucleotide variants of FAN1 have been linked to karyomegalic interstitial nephritis, 15q13.3 microdeletion/microduplication syndrome (autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy), cancer, and most recently repeat expansion diseases. For seven CAG repeat expansion diseases (Huntington’s disease (HD) and certain spinocerebellar ataxias), modification of age of onset is linked to variants of specific DNA repair proteins. FAN1 variants are the strongest modifiers. Non-coding disease-delaying FAN1 variants and coding disease-hastening variants (p.R507H and p.R377W) are known, where the former may lead to increased FAN1 levels and the latter have unknown effects upon FAN1 functions. Current thoughts are that ongoing repeat expansions in disease-vulnerable tissues, as individuals age, promote disease onset. Fan1 is required to suppress against high levels of ongoing somatic CAG and CGG repeat expansions in tissues of HD and FMR1 transgenic mice respectively, in addition to participating in DNA interstrand crosslink repair. FAN1 is also a modifier of autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Coupled with the association of these diseases with repeat expansions, this suggests a common mechanism, by which FAN1 modifies repeat diseases. Yet how any of the FAN1 variants modify disease is unknown. Here, we review FAN1 variants, associated clinical effects, protein structure, and the enzyme’s attributed functional roles. We highlight how variants may alter its activities in DNA damage response and/or repeat instability. A thorough awareness of the FAN1 gene and FAN1 protein functions will reveal if and how it may be targeted for clinical benefit.},

The present review summarizes, in the first part, the role of mismatch repair in detecting and fixing the DNA strand slippage occurring during microsatellite replication. In the second part, key molecular differences between normal microsatellites and those that show a bias toward expansions are extensively presented. The effect of mismatch repair mutants on microsatellite expansions is detailed in model systems, and in vitro experiments on mismatched DNA substrates are described.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}DNA transcription and replication are two essential physiological processes that can turn into a threat for genome integrity when they compete for the same DNA substrate. During transcription, the nascent RNA strongly binds the template DNA strand, leading to the formation of a peculiar RNA–DNA hybrid structure that displaces the non-template single-stranded DNA. This three-stranded nucleic acid transition is called R-loop. Although a programed formation of R-loops plays important physiological functions, these structures can turn into sources of DNA damage and genome instability when their homeostasis is altered. Indeed, both R-loop level and distribution in the genome are tightly controlled, and the list of factors involved in these regulatory mechanisms is continuously growing. Over the last years, our knowledge of R-loop homeostasis regulation (formation, stabilization, and resolution) has definitely increased. However, how R-loops affect genome stability and how the cellular response to their unscheduled formation is orchestrated are still not fully understood. In this review, we will report and discuss recent findings about these questions and we will focus on the role of ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) and Ataxia–telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinases in the activation of an R-loop-dependent DNA damage response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While there is a significant depth of information on DNA damage repair, with many drugs and drug targets, most of this development has taken place in the context of cancer therapy. DNA damage repair in neurons does not rely on DNA replication correction mechanisms. However, there is a strong connection between DNA repair and neuronal metabolism, mediated by nucleotide salvaging and the poly ADP-ribose (PAR) response, and this connection has been implicated in other age-onset neurodegenerative diseases. Validation of leads including the mismatch repair protein MSH3, and interstrand cross-link repair protein FAN1, suggest the mechanism is driven by somatic CAG instability, which is supported by the protective effect of CAA substitutions in the CAG tract. We currently do not understand: how somatic instability is triggered; the state of DNA damage within expanding alleles in the brain; whether this damage induces mismatch repair and interstrand cross-link pathways; whether instability mediates toxicity, and how this relates to human ageing. We discuss DNA damage pathways uncovered by HD GWAS, known roles of other polyglutamine disease proteins in DNA damage repair, and a panel of hypotheses for pathogenic mechanisms.},

This provides an exciting opportunity to advance therapeutic development in HD, as these pathways have already been under intense investigation in cancer research. Also emerging are the roles of other polyglutamine disease proteins in DNA damage repair mechanisms. A potential universal trigger of oxidative DNA damage shared in these late age–onset diseases is the increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human aging, defining an age-related mechanism that has defied other hypotheses of neurodegeneration. We discuss the potential commonality of DNA damage repair pathways in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Potential targets for therapy that may prove beneficial across many of these diseases are also identified, defining nodes in the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) complex, mismatch repair, and poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs).},

The normal CAG repeat range is 5–36, whereas 38 or more repeats are found in the diseased state; the severity of disease is roughly proportional to the number of CAG repeats1,2,3,4,5. HD shows anticipation, in which subsequent generations display earlier disease onsets due to intergenerational repeat expansion1,2,3,4,5,6. For longer repeat lengths, somatic instability of the repeat size has been observed both in human cases at autopsy7,8 and in transgenic mouse models containing either a genomic fragment of human HD exon 1 (ref. 9) or an expanded repeat inserted into the endogenous mouse gene Hdh (ref. 10). With increasing repeat number, the protein changes conformation and becomes increasingly prone to aggregation11, suggesting important functional correlations between repeat length and pathology. Because dinucleotide repeat instability is known to increase when the mismatch repair enzyme MSH2 is missing12,13,14,15, we examined instability of the HD CAG repeat by crossing transgenic mice carrying exon 1 of human HD (ref. 16) with Msh2–/– mice15. Our results show that Msh2 is required for somatic instability of the CAG repeat.},

Since the ongoing somatic repeat expansions can affect disease age-of-onset, severity, and progression, targeting somatic expansion holds potential as a therapeutic target. Thus, understanding the factors that regulate this mutation is crucial. DNA repair, in particular mismatch repair (MMR), is the major driving force of disease-associated repeat expansions. In contrast to its anti-mutagenic roles, mammalian MMR curiously drives the expansion mutations of disease-associated (CAG)·(CTG) repeats. Recent advances have broadened our knowledge of both the MMR proteins involved in disease repeat expansions, including: MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, and MLH3, as well as the types of repeats affected by MMR, now including: (CAG)·(CTG), (CGG)·(CCG), and (GAA)·(TTC) repeats. Mutagenic slipped-DNA structures have been detected in patient tissues, and the size of the slip-out and their junction conformation can determine the involvement of MMR. Furthermore, the formation of other unusual DNA and R-loop structures is proposed to play a key role in MMR-mediated instability. A complex correlation is emerging between tissues showing varying amounts of repeat instability and MMR expression levels. Notably, naturally occurring polymorphic variants of DNA repair genes can have dramatic effects upon the levels of repeat instability, which may explain the variation in disease age-of-onset, progression and severity. An increasing grasp of these factors holds prognostic and therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {R-loops form when transcribed RNA remains bound to its DNA template to form a stable RNA:DNA hybrid. Stable R-loops form when the RNA is purine-rich, and are further stabilized by DNA secondary structures on the non-template strand. Interestingly, many expandable and disease-causing repeat sequences form stable R-loops, and R-loops can contribute to repeat instability. Repeat expansions are responsible for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophy, and several types of ataxias. Recently, it was found that R-loops at an expanded CAG/CTG repeat tract cause DNA breaks as well as repeat instability (Su and Freudenreich, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 114, E8392–E8401, 2017). Two factors were identified as causing R-loop-dependent breaks at CAG/CTG tracts: deamination of cytosines and the MutLγ (Mlh1–Mlh3) endonuclease, defining two new mechanisms for how R-loops can generate DNA breaks (Su and Freudenreich, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 114, E8392–E8401, 2017). Following R-loop-dependent nicking, base excision repair resulted in repeat instability. These results have implications for human repeat expansion diseases and provide a paradigm for how RNA:DNA hybrids can cause genome instability at structure-forming DNA sequences. This perspective summarizes mechanisms of R-loop-induced fragility at G-rich repeats and new links between DNA breaks and repeat instability.},

This is the case for phage polymerases, as used here (T7 RNA polymerase), as well as RNA polymerases in bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, avians, mice, and humans. The nontemplate strand is left in a single-stranded configuration within the R-loop region. These structures are known to form at mammalian immunoglobulin class switch regions, thus exposing regions of single-stranded DNA for the action of AID, a single-strand-specific cytidine deaminase. R-loops form by thread-back of the RNA onto the template DNA strand, and here we report that G clusters are extremely important for the initiation phase of R-loop formation. Even very short regions with one GGGG sequence can initiate R-loops much more efficiently than random sequences. The high efficiencies observed with G clusters cannot be achieved by having a very high G density alone. Annealing of the transcript, which is otherwise disadvantaged relative to the nontemplate DNA strand because of unfavorable proximity while exiting the RNA polymerase, can offer greater stability if it occurs at the G clusters, thereby initiating an R-loop. R-loop elongation beyond the initiation zone occurs in a manner that is not as reliant on G clusters as it is on a high G density. These results lead to a model in which G clusters are important to nucleate the thread-back of RNA for R-loop initiation and, once initiated, the elongation of R-loops is primarily determined by the density of G on the nontemplate DNA strand. Without both a favorable R-loop initiation zone and elongation zone, R-loop formation is inefficient.},

Here we report the first molecular crosstalk mechanism, in which MSH2–MSH3 is used as a component of the BER machinery to cause expansion. On its own, pol β fails to copy TNRs during DNA synthesis, and bypasses them on the template strand to cause deletion. Remarkably, MSH2–MSH3 not only stimulates pol β to copy through the repeats but also enhances formation of the flap precursor for expansion. Our results provide direct evidence that MMR and BER, operating together, form a novel hybrid pathway that changes the outcome of TNR instability from deletion to expansion during the removal of oxidized bases. We propose that cells implement crosstalk strategies and share machinery when a canonical pathway is ineffective in removing a difficult lesion., 
The expansion of trinucleotide repeats can have detrimental effects and give rise to a range of human diseases. Here the authors report that the mismatch repair and the base excision repair machinery can operate together to promote expansion during lesion removal.},

	abstract = {CAG/CTG repeats are structure-forming repetitive DNA sequences, and expansion beyond a threshold of ∼35 CAG repeats is the cause of several human diseases. Expanded CAG repeats are prone to breakage, and repair of the breaks can cause repeat contractions and expansions. In this study, we found that cotranscriptional R-loops formed at a CAG-70 repeat inserted into a yeast chromosome. R-loops were further elevated upon deletion of yeast RNaseH genes and caused repeat fragility. A significant increase in CAG repeat contractions was also observed, consistent with previous human cell studies. Deletion of yeast cytosine deaminase Fcy1 significantly decreased the rate of CAG repeat fragility and contractions in the rnh1Δrnh201Δ background, indicating that Fcy1-mediated deamination is one cause of breakage and contractions in the presence of R-loops. Furthermore, base excision repair (BER) is responsible for causing CAG repeat contractions downstream of Fcy1, but not fragility. The Rad1/XPF and Rad2/XPG nucleases were also important in protecting against contractions, but through BER rather than nucleotide excision repair. Surprisingly, the MutLγ (Mlh1/Mlh3) endonuclease caused R-loop–dependent CAG fragility, defining an alternative function for this complex. These findings provide evidence that breakage at expanded CAG repeats occurs due to R-loop formation and reveal two mechanisms for CAG repeat instability: one mediated by cytosine deamination of DNA engaged in R-loops and the other by MutLγ cleavage. Since disease-causing CAG repeats occur in transcribed regions, our results suggest that R-loop–mediated fragility is a mechanism that could cause DNA damage and repeat-length changes in human cells.},

	abstract = {Background
Age at onset of Huntington's disease (HD) is largely determined by the CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the HTT gene. Importantly, the CAG repeat undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, prevalent in brain regions that are disease targets, suggesting a potential role for somatic CAG repeat instability in modifying HD pathogenesis. Thus, understanding underlying mechanisms of somatic CAG repeat instability may lead to discoveries of novel therapeutics for HD. Investigation of the dynamics of the CAG repeat size changes over time may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying CAG repeat instability.

Methodology/Principal Findings
To understand how the HTT CAG repeat length changes over time, we quantified somatic instability of the CAG repeat in Huntington's disease CAG knock-in mice from 2–16 months of age in liver, striatum, spleen and tail. The HTT CAG repeat in spleen and tail was very stable, but that in liver and striatum expanded over time at an average rate of one CAG per month. Interestingly, the patterns of repeat instability were different between liver and striatum. Unstable CAG repeats in liver repeatedly gained similar sizes of additional CAG repeats (approximately two CAGs per month), maintaining a distinct population of unstable repeats. In contrast, unstable CAG repeats in striatum gained additional repeats with different sizes resulting in broadly distributed unstable CAG repeats. Expanded CAG repeats in the liver were highly enriched in polyploid hepatocytes, suggesting that the pattern of liver instability may reflect the restriction of the unstable repeats to a unique cell type.

Conclusions/Significance
Our results are consistent with repeat expansion occurring as a consequence of recurrent small repeat insertions that differ in different tissues. Investigation of the specific mechanisms that underlie liver and striatal instability will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between instability and disease and the means to intervene in this process.},

Broad ranges of repeat instability arise between individuals with expanded repeats, suggesting the existence of modifiers of repeat instability. Mice with expanded CAG/CTG repeats show variable levels of instability depending upon mouse strain. However, to date the genetic modifiers underlying these differences have not been identified. We show that in liver and striatum the R6/1 Huntington's disease (HD) (CAG)∼100 transgene, when present in a congenic C57BL/6J (B6) background, incurred expansion-biased repeat mutations, whereas the repeat was stable in a congenic BALB/cByJ (CBy) background. Reciprocal congenic mice revealed the Msh3 gene as the determinant for the differences in repeat instability. Expansion bias was observed in congenic mice homozygous for the B6 Msh3 gene on a CBy background, while the CAG tract was stabilized in congenics homozygous for the CBy Msh3 gene on a B6 background. The CAG stabilization was as dramatic as genetic deficiency of Msh2. The B6 and CBy Msh3 genes had identical promoters but differed in coding regions and showed strikingly different protein levels. B6 MSH3 variant protein is highly expressed and associated with CAG expansions, while the CBy MSH3 variant protein is expressed at barely detectable levels, associating with CAG stability. The DHFR protein, which is divergently transcribed from a promoter shared by the Msh3 gene, did not show varied levels between mouse strains. Thus, naturally occurring MSH3 protein polymorphisms are modifiers of CAG repeat instability, likely through variable MSH3 protein stability. Since evidence supports that somatic CAG instability is a modifier and predictor of disease, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that variable levels of CAG instability associated with polymorphisms of DNA repair genes may have prognostic implications for various repeat-associated diseases.},

	abstract = {The Huntington's disease gene (HTT) CAG repeat mutation undergoes somatic expansion that correlates with pathogenesis. Modifiers of somatic expansion may therefore provide routes for therapies targeting the underlying mutation, an approach that is likely applicable to other trinucleotide repeat diseases. Huntington's disease HdhQ111 mice exhibit higher levels of somatic HTT CAG expansion on a C57BL/6 genetic background (B6.HdhQ111) than on a 129 background (129.HdhQ111). Linkage mapping in (B6x129).HdhQ111 F2 intercross animals identified a single quantitative trait locus underlying the strain-specific difference in expansion in the striatum, implicating mismatch repair (MMR) gene Mlh1 as the most likely candidate modifier. Crossing B6.HdhQ111 mice onto an Mlh1 null background demonstrated that Mlh1 is essential for somatic CAG expansions and that it is an enhancer of nuclear huntingtin accumulation in striatal neurons. HdhQ111 somatic expansion was also abolished in mice deficient in the Mlh3 gene, implicating MutLγ (MLH1–MLH3) complex as a key driver of somatic expansion. Strikingly, Mlh1 and Mlh3 genes encoding MMR effector proteins were as critical to somatic expansion as Msh2 and Msh3 genes encoding DNA mismatch recognition complex MutSβ (MSH2–MSH3). The Mlh1 locus is highly polymorphic between B6 and 129 strains. While we were unable to detect any difference in base-base mismatch or short slipped-repeat repair activity between B6 and 129 MLH1 variants, repair efficiency was MLH1 dose-dependent. MLH1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in 129 mice compared to B6 mice, consistent with a dose-sensitive MLH1-dependent DNA repair mechanism underlying the somatic expansion difference between these strains. Together, these data identify Mlh1 and Mlh3 as novel critical genetic modifiers of HTT CAG instability, point to Mlh1 genetic variation as the likely source of the instability difference in B6 and 129 strains and suggest that MLH1 protein levels play an important role in driving of the efficiency of somatic expansions.},

	abstract = {The expansion of CAG·CTG repeat sequences is the cause of several inherited human disorders. Longer alleles are associated with an earlier age of onset and more severe symptoms, and are highly unstable in the germline and soma with a marked tendency towards repeat length gains. Germinal expansions underlie anticipation; whereas age-dependent, tissue-specific, expansion-biased somatic instability probably contributes toward the progressive nature and tissue-specificity of the symptoms. The mechanism(s) of repeat instability is not known, but recent data have implicated mismatch-repair (MMR) gene mutS homologues in driving expansion. To gain further insight into the expansion mechanism, we have determined the levels of somatic mosaicism of a transgenic expanded CAG·CTG repeat in mice deficient for the Pms2 MMR gene. Pms2 is a MutL homologue that plays a critical role in the downstream processing of DNA mismatches. The rate of somatic expansion was reduced by ∼50\% in Pms2-null mice. A higher frequency of rare, but very large, deletions was also detected in these animals. No significant differences were observed between Pms2+/+ and Pms2+/− mice, indicating that a single functional Pms2 allele is sufficient to generate normal levels of somatic mosaicism. These findings reveal that as well as MMR enzymes that directly bind mismatched DNA, proteins that are subsequently recruited to the complex also play a central role in the accumulation of repeat length changes. These data suggest that somatic expansion results not by replication slippage, single stranded annealing or simple MutS-mediated stabilization of secondary structures, but by inappropriate DNA MMR.},

We discovered damaging coding variants in candidate modifier genes identified in previous genome-wide association studies associated with altered HD onset or severity. Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and were associated predominantly with earlier-onset HD. Nuclease activities of purified variants in vitro correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD.

The current research paradigm for Huntington's disease is based on participants with overt clinical phenotypes and does not address its pathophysiology nor the biomarker changes that can precede by decades the functional decline. We have generated a new research framework to standardise clinical research and enable interventional studies earlier in the disease course. The Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS) comprises a biological research definition and evidence-based staging centred on biological, clinical, and functional assessments. We used a formal consensus method that involved representatives from academia, industry, and non-profit organisations. The HD-ISS characterises individuals for research purposes from birth, starting at Stage 0 (ie, individuals with the Huntington's disease genetic mutation without any detectable pathological change) by using a genetic definition of Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease progression is then marked by measurable indicators of underlying pathophysiology (Stage 1), a detectable clinical phenotype (Stage 2), and then decline in function (Stage 3). Individuals can be precisely classified into stages based on thresholds of stage-specific landmark assessments. We also demonstrated the internal validity of this system. The adoption of the HD-ISS could facilitate the design of clinical trials targeting populations before clinical motor diagnosis and enable data standardisation across ongoing and future studies.},

	abstract = {Objective:
Fragile X premutation carriers are reported to have increased neuropsychiatric problems, and thus the term fragile X–associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) has been proposed. Unfortunately, published prevalence estimates of these phenomena are inconsistent. This systematic review clarified this issue by reviewing both fragile X premutation prevalence in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorder prevalence in premutation carriers without fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Average prevalence was derived from studies that used semistructured clinical interviews, diagnostic criteria, and validated rating scales.
Methods:
Forty-six studies were reviewed. The rate of fragile X premutation in neurodevelopmental disorders was assessed from five studies. Probands with neurodevelopmental disorders were more likely than those in the general population to be premutation carriers. The rate of psychiatric disorders in premutation carriers was assessed from five studies for neurodevelopmental, 13 studies for mood, 12 studies for anxiety, and two studies for psychotic disorders. The phenotype and sex distribution among premutation carriers were similar to those with fragile X syndrome.
Results:
Compared to control group and general population estimates, the most prevalent psychiatric disorders were neurodevelopmental disorders, anxiety disorders, and bipolar II disorder. Psychiatric disorders were also more common in males. Most studies relied only on past medical history to define the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, yielding variability in results.
Conclusions:
Future studies are needed to avoid bias by identifying cohorts from population-based sampling, to describe cohort demographic characteristics to elucidate differences in age and sex, and to prioritize the use of validated psychiatric assessment methods.},

These full mutation (FM) alleles are associated with DNA methylation and gene silencing, which result in intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and social and behavioral issues. Mosaicism for both the size of the CGG repeat tract and the extent of its methylation is commonly observed in individuals with the FM. Mosaicism has also been reported in carriers of premutation (PM) alleles, which have 55–200 CGG repeats. PM alleles confer risk for the fragile X premutation-associated conditions (FXPAC), including FXTAS, FXPOI, and FXAND, conditions thought to be due to the toxic consequences of transcripts containing large CGG-tracts. Unmethylated FM (UFM) alleles are transcriptionally and translationally active. Thus, they produce transcripts with toxic effects. These transcripts do produce some FMRP, the encoded product of the FMR1 gene, albeit with reduced translational efficiency. As a result, mosaicism can result in a complex clinical presentation. Here, we review the concept of mosaicism in both FXS and in PM carriers, including its potential clinical significance.},

	abstract = {The fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene contains an expansion-prone CGG repeat within its 5′ UTR. Alleles with 55–200 repeats are known as premutation (PM) alleles and confer risk for one or more of the FMR1 premutation (PM) disorders that include Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and Fragile X-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND). PM alleles expand on intergenerational transmission, with the children of PM mothers being at risk of inheriting alleles with {\textgreater} 200 CGG repeats (full mutation FM) alleles) and thus developing Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). PM alleles can be somatically unstable. This can lead to individuals being mosaic for multiple size alleles. Here, we describe a detailed evaluation of somatic mosaicism in a large cohort of female PM carriers and show that 94\% display some evidence of somatic instability with the presence of a series of expanded alleles that differ from the next allele by a single repeat unit. Using two different metrics for instability that we have developed, we show that, as with intergenerational instability, there is a direct relationship between the extent of somatic expansion and the number of CGG repeats in the originally inherited allele and an inverse relationship with the number of AGG interruptions. Expansions are progressive as evidenced by a positive correlation with age and by examination of blood samples from the same individual taken at different time points. Our data also suggests the existence of other genetic or environmental factors that affect the extent of somatic expansion. Importantly, the analysis of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suggests that two DNA repair factors, FAN1 and MSH3, may be modifiers of somatic expansion risk in the PM population as observed in other repeat expansion disorders.},

The analysis of polysomes/mRNPs distribution of mRNA in the cell lines with a premutation shows that the polysomal association of FMR1 mRNA, which is high in normal cells, becomes progressively lower with increasing CGG repeat expansion. In addition, we could detect a very low level of FMR1 mRNA in a lymphoblastoid cell line from a patient with a full mutation. In this case, FMR1 mRNA is not at all associated with polysomes, in agreement with the complete absence of FMRP.

The circular dichroism (CD) spectra and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) reveal that CGG DNA (sense strand of the FMR1 gene) and its transcript favor a quadruplex structure. CD, EMSA and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also show that more than four C…C mismatches cannot be accommodated in the RNA duplex consisting of the CCG repeat (antisense transcript); instead, it favors an i-motif conformational intermediate. Such a preference for unusual secondary structures provides a convincing justification for the RNA foci formation due to the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins to the bidirectional transcripts and the repeat-associated non-AUG translation that are observed in FXTAS. The results presented here also suggest that small molecule modulators that can destabilize FMR1 CGG DNA and RNA quadruplex structures could be promising candidates for treating FXTAS.},

Although the mutant protein is widely expressed, the earliest and most striking neuropathological changes are observed in the striatum. Here we show dramatic mutation length increases (gains of up to 1000 CAG repeats) in human striatal cells early in the disease course, most likely before the onset of pathological cell loss. Studies of knock-in HD mouse models indicate that the size of the initial CAG repeat mutation may influence both onset and tissue-specific patterns of age-dependent, expansion-biased mutation length variability. Given that CAG repeat length strongly correlates with clinical severity, we suggest that somatic increases of mutation length may play a major role in the progressive nature and cell-selective aspects of both adult-onset and juvenile-onset HD pathogenesis and we discuss the implications of this interpretation of the data presented.},

The expansion-biased changes increase with age, such that some striatal cells from old HD mice contain mutations that have tripled in size. If this pattern of repeat instability is recapitulated in human striatal tissue, the concomitant increased polyglutamine load may contribute to the patterns of selective neuronal cell death in HD.

Analysis of the mutation in vivo reveals significant levels of germline instability, with expansions, contractions and sex-of-origin effects in evidence. Mice expressing full-length mutant protein display abnormal social behaviour in the absence of acute neurodegeneration. Given that psychiatric changes, including irritability and aggression, are common findings in HD patients, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that some clinical features of HD may be caused by pathological processes that precede gross neuronal cell death. This implies that effective treatment of HD may require an understanding and amelioration of these dysfunctional processes, rather than simply preventing the premature death of neurons in the brain.

The findings provide evidence for simultaneous degeneration and growth of spiny neurons in Huntington's disease and support the view that a specific population of neostriatal neurons is selectively involved in its pathogenesis.},

Expansion in mice primarily affects brain, testis and liver with very little expansion in heart or blood. Our data would be consistent with a simple two-factor model for the organ specificity. Somatic expansion in humans may contribute to the mosaicism often seen in individuals with one of the FXDs. Since expansion risk and disease severity are related to repeat number, somatic expansion may exacerbate disease severity and contribute to the age-related increased risk of expansion seen on paternal transmission in humans. Since little somatic expansion occurs in murine lymphocytes, our data also raise the possibility that there may be discordance in humans between repeat numbers measured in blood and that present in brain. This could explain, at least in part, the variable penetrance seen in some of these disorders.},

The mutation responsible for all of these diseases is an expansion in the size of a disease-specific tandem repeat tract. However, the underlying cause of this unusual mutation is unknown. Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the FAN1 (MIM 613534) gene that are associated with variations in the age at onset of a number of Repeat Expansion Diseases. FAN1 is a nuclease that has both 5’-3’ exonuclease and 5’ flap endonuclease activities. Here we show in a model for the FXDs that Fan1−/− mice have expansions that, in some tissues including brain, are 2-3 times as extensive as they are in Fan1+/+ mice. However, no effect of the loss of FAN1 was apparent for germ line expansions. Thus, FAN1 plays an important role in protecting against somatic expansions but is either not involved in protecting against intergenerational repeat expansions or is redundant with other related enzymes. However, since loss of FAN1 results in increased expansions in brain and other somatic tissue, FAN1 polymorphisms may be important disease modifiers in those Repeat Expansion Diseases in which somatic expansion contributes to age at onset or disease severity.},

Here we show that MLH1/MLH3 (MutLγ), a protein complex that can act downstream of MutSβ in MMR, is also required for all germ line and somatic expansions. However, exonuclease I (EXO1), which acts downstream of MutL proteins in MMR, is not required. In fact, a null mutation in Exo1 results in more extensive germ line and somatic expansions than is seen in Exo1+/+ animals. Furthermore, mice homozygous for a point mutation (D173A) in Exo1 that eliminates its nuclease activity but retains its native conformation, shows a level of expansion that is intermediate between Exo1+/+ and Exo1-/- animals. Thus, our data suggests that expansion of the FX repeat in this mouse model occurs via a MutLγ-dependent, EXO1-independent pathway, with EXO1 protecting against expansion both in a nuclease-dependent and a nuclease-independent manner. Our data thus have implications for the expansion mechanism and add to our understanding of the genetic factors that may be modifiers of expansion risk in humans.},

Here we show that the MSH2/MSH6 complex, MutSα also contributes to the production of both germ line and somatic expansions as evidenced by the reduction in the number of expansions observed in Msh6-/- mice. This effect is not mediated via an indirect effect of the loss of MSH6 on the level of MSH3. However, since MutSβ is required for 98\% of germ line expansions and almost all somatic ones, MutSα is apparently not able to efficiently substitute for MutSβ in the expansion process. Using purified human proteins we demonstrate that MutSα, like MutSβ, binds to substrates with loop-outs of the repeats and increases the thermal stability of the structures that they form. We also show that MutSα facilitates binding of MutSβ to these loop-outs. These data suggest possible models for the contribution of MutSα to repeat expansion. In addition, we show that unlike MutSβ, MutSα may also act to protect against repeat contractions in the Fmr1 gene.},

In this report, we describe the behaviour of an expanded CTG repeat in the 3′ untranslated region of the DMPK gene in VUB03\_DM1, a hESC line carrying the myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) mutation compared with the normal CTG repeat in two hESC lines VUB01 and VUB04\_CF. Expanded CTG repeats were detected by small amount PCR, small pool PCR and Southern blot analysis in consecutive passages of VUB03\_DM1. An important instability of the CTG repeat was detected during prolonged in vitro culture, showing stepwise increases of the repeat number in consecutive passages as well as a higher range of variability. This variability was present in cells of different colonies of the same passage and even within single colonies. The high repeat instability is in contrast to the previously observed stability of the repeat in preimplantation embryos and in fetuses during the first trimester of pregnancy. This in vitro culture of affected hESC represents a valuable model for studying the biology of repeat instability.},

The relatively small (CAG)44 HD expansion was stable in undifferentiated and differentiated HD hESCs. In contrast, the DM1 repeat showed instability from the earliest passages onwards in DM1 hESCs with (CTG)250 or (CTG)1800. Upon differentiation the DM1 repeat was stabilized. MMR genes, including hMSH2, hMSH3 and hMSH6 were assessed at the transcript and protein levels in differentiated cells. The coincidence of differentiation-induced down-regulated MMR expression with reduced instability of the long expanded repeats in hESCs is consistent with a known requirement of MMR proteins for repeat instability in transgenic mice. This is the first demonstration of a correlation between altered repeat instability of an endogenous DM1 locus and natural MMR down-regulation, in contrast to the commonly used murine knock-down systems.},

The status of cell division determines the mechanism of expansion.Large expansions occur in non-dividing cells. Large repeat tracts are deleted in spermatogonia.Pre-mutation alleles can expand or contract in dividing and non-dividing cells.In non-dividing cells, expansion is likely to occur during excision repair. Candidate pathways are base excision repair or transcription-coupled repair.Oxidative damage of DNA bases is corrected by base excision repair and expansion occurs during the process of removing oxidized bases. Loss of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1, also known as N-glycosylase/DNA lyase) in mice suppresses expansion.Cockayne syndrome protein CSB (also known as ERCC6) and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group G (XPG) have been implicated in instability of CAG repeats in flies and in human cells.In dividing cells, replication dependent repair mechanisms, such as polymerase 'back-up' and trans-lesion synthesis, are candidates for causing expansion.Expansion is a two-step process in which DNA loops are formed and then incorporated into DNA. The two steps may occur by distinct mechanisms.The mismatch repair system may be involved in forming the DNA loops that become expansions and may also be involved in loop incorporation into DNA.Progress in this field will require the integration of various strategies, including genetic and biochemical methods and analysis of DNA repair crosstalk and chromatin dynamics.},

It has been shown that the severity of disease symptoms, age of onset and progression are related to the length of the triplet repeats. However, the mechanism(s) of CTG·CAG triplet-repeat instability is not fully understood. Herein, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from DM1 and Huntington's disease patient fibroblasts. We isolated 41 iPSC clones from DM1 fibroblasts, all showing different CTG·CAG repeat lengths, thus demonstrating somatic instability within the initial fibroblast population. During propagation of the iPSCs, the repeats expanded in a manner analogous to the expansion seen in somatic cells from DM1 patients. The correlation between repeat length and expansion rate identified the interval between 57 and 126 repeats as being an important length threshold where expansion rates dramatically increased. Moreover, longer repeats showed faster triplet-repeat expansion. However, the overall tendency of triplet repeats to expand ceased on differentiation into differentiated embryoid body or neurospheres. The mismatch repair components MSH2, MSH3 and MSH6 were highly expressed in iPSCs compared with fibroblasts, and only occupied the DMPK1 gene harboring longer CTG·CAG triplet repeats. In addition, shRNA silencing of MSH2 impeded CTG·CAG triplet-repeat expansion. The information gained from these studies provides new insight into a general mechanism of triplet-repeat expansion in iPSCs.},

CAG repeat length explains around half of the variation in age at onset (AAO) but genetic variation elsewhere in the genome accounts for a significant proportion of the remainder. Genome-wide association studies have identified a bidirectional signal on chromosome 15, likely underlain by FANCD2- and FANCI-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), a nuclease involved in DNA interstrand cross link repair. Here we show that increased FAN1 expression is significantly associated with delayed AAO and slower progression of HD, suggesting FAN1 is protective in the context of an expanded HTT CAG repeat. FAN1 overexpression in human cells reduces CAG repeat expansion in exogenously expressed mutant HTT exon 1, and in patient-derived stem cells and differentiated medium spiny neurons, FAN1 knockdown increases CAG repeat expansion. The stabilizing effects are FAN1 concentration and CAG repeat length-dependent. We show that FAN1 binds to the expanded HTT CAG repeat DNA and its nuclease activity is not required for protection against CAG repeat expansion. These data shed new mechanistic insights into how the genetic modifiers of HD act to alter disease progression and show that FAN1 affects somatic expansion of the CAG repeat through a nuclease-independent mechanism. This provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in HD and potentially other triplet repeat disorders.},

By intercrossing mice with Fen1 deficiency with transgenics with a DM1 (CTG)n·(CAG)n repeat (where 104⩽n⩽110), we demonstrate that Fen1 is not essential for faithful maintenance of this repeat in early embryonic cleavage divisions until the blastocyst stage. Additionally, we found that the frequency of somatic DM1 (CTG)n·(CAG)n repeat instability was essentially unaltered in mice with Fen1 haploinsufficiency up to 1.5 years of age. Based on these findings, we propose that Fen1, despite its role in DNA repair and replication, is not primarily involved in maintaining stability at the DM1 locus.},

	abstract = {Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) instability is the cause of over 40 human neurodegenerative diseases and certain types of cancer. TNR instability can result from DNA replication, repair, recombination, and gene transcription. Emerging evidence indicates that DNA base damage and base excision repair (BER) play an active role in regulating somatic TNR instability. These processes may potentially modulate the onset and progression of TNR-related diseases, given that TNRs are hotspots of DNA base damage that are present in mammalian cells with a high frequency. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BER-mediated TNR instability. We initially discuss the roles of the BER pathway and locations of DNA base lesions in TNRs and their interplay with non-B form DNA structures in governing repeat instability. We then discuss how the coordinated activities of BER enzymes can modulate a balance between the removal and addition of TNRs to regulate somatic TNR instability. We further discuss how this balance can be disrupted by the crosstalk between BER and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) machinery resulting in TNR expansion. Finally, we suggest future directions regarding BER-mediated somatic TNR instability and its association with TNR disease prevention and treatment.},

Genome-wide association studies of people with Huntington’s disease revealed a strong association between the FAN1 R507H mutation and early disease onset, however the underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. FAN1 has previously been implicated in modulating triplet repeat expansion in a PCNA dependent manner. To examine the role of PCNA on FAN1 activation, we solved the cryo-EM structures of a PCNA–FAN1–DNA complex. Our findings reveal that the FAN1 R507 residue directly interacts with PCNA D232. Biophysical interaction studies demonstrated that FAN1 enhances the binding affinity of PCNA for DNA, a synergistic effect disrupted in mutants carrying the R507H mutation. In contrast, PCNA does not affect the affinity of FAN1 for DNA but does modulate FAN1 activity upon ternary complex formation. The weakened and functionally altered FAN1 R507H–PCNA–DNA complex may partly impair the FAN1-mediated repair of CAG extrahelical extrusions, providing a potential explanation for the mutation’s role in accelerating disease progression.},

Electromyography revealed myopathic changes and myotonic discharges. Both cardiologic and pneumologic evaluation did not reveal abnormalities. Muscle computed tomography images showed adipose tissue replacement of abdominis rectus, lateral vastus, adductor magnus, and both the posterior and anterior compartment muscles below the knee, with prevalent involvement of medial gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle biopsy uncovered changes in fiber size and the presence of atrophic fibers with rimmed vacuoles of varying diameter, and core-like structures in type I fibers. Diagnosis was performed according to clinical and histopathologic findings, which were fully consistent with the other reported patients, and on the genetic exclusion of similar conditions such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1 and multi-minicore disease associated to RYR1 mutations. Differential diagnosis with mitochondrial myopathies, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and distal myopathies was also considered.

This paper aims to synthesise the broader perspectives of Māori patients and their whānau (extended family, family group) of their treatment within the public health system. Our research question was ‘What are the experiences of Māori in the public health and/or hospital system in Aotearoa New Zealand?’
Methods:
A systematic search using PRISMA protocols and reflexive typology organised around the categories of Māori, public healthcare and qualitative research identified 14 papers that covered all three categories. We undertook a qualitative metasynthesis on these papers using a critical community psychology approach.
Results:
Māori patients and whānau from the included papers mention both barriers and facilitators to health. We categorised barriers as organisational structures, staff interactions and practical considerations. Facilitators were categorised as the provision of whānau support in the form of practical assistance, emotional care and health system navigation.
Conclusions:
For many Māori, the existing public health system is experienced as hostile and alienating. Whānau members provide support to mitigate this, but it comes as a cost to whānau.
Implications for public health:
Public health providers must find ways to ensure that Māori consistently experience positive, high‐quality healthcare interactions that support Māori ways of being.},

This article, using a case study approach focusing on Māori, documents these historic inequalities and discusses policy attempts to address them from the 1970s when the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi were first introduced in legislation. This period is one of increasing self-determination for Māori, but notwithstanding this, Māori continued to have significantly shorter life expectancy than the population as a whole and suffered poor health at much higher rates. Neo-liberal policies were introduced and expanded during the 1980s and 1990s in New Zealand, including in healthcare from the early 1990s. The introduction of the purchaser-provider split in health services and the focus on devolving responsibility to communities provided an opportunity for Māori health providers to be established. However, the neo-liberal economic and social welfare policies implemented during this time also worked against Māori and adversely affected their health. By analysing attempts to reduce inequity in health outcomes for Māori, we explore why these collective attempts, including by Māori themselves, did not result in overall improved health and increased life expectancy for Māori. There was often a significant gap between government rhetoric and action, and we suggest that a predominantly universal healthcare system did not accommodate cultural and ethnic differences, and this is a potential explanation for the failure to reduce inequities. While this is true for all minority ethnic groups it is even more crucial for Māori as New Zealand's tangata whenua (first people) who had been progressively disadvantaged under colonialism. However, the seeds of ideas around Māori-led healthcare were planted in this period and have become part of the current Labour Government's policy on health reform.},

A recent Huntington’s disease genome-wide association study found rs557874766, an imputed single nucleotide polymorphism located within a polymorphic 9 bp tandem repeat in MSH3/DHFR, as the variant most significantly associated with progression in Huntington’s disease. Using Illumina sequencing in Huntington’s disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 subjects, we show that rs557874766 is an alignment artefact, the minor allele for which corresponds to a three-repeat allele in MSH3 exon 1 that is associated with a reduced rate of somatic CAG·CTG expansion (P = 0.004) and delayed disease onset (P = 0.003) in both Huntington’s disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1, and slower progression (P = 3.86 × 10−7) in Huntington’s disease. RNA-Seq of whole blood in the Huntington’s disease subjects found that repeat variants are associated with MSH3 and DHFR expression. A transcriptome-wide association study in the Huntington’s disease cohort found increased MSH3 and DHFR expression are associated with disease progression. These results suggest that variation in the MSH3 exon 1 repeat region influences somatic expansion and disease phenotype in Huntington’s disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1, and suggests a common DNA repair mechanism operates in both repeat expansion diseases.},
