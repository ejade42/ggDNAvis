Must also contain \"direction\" column \"forward\" \"reverse\" (e.g. c(\"forward\", \"forward\", \"reverse\")) indicating direction read.Important: Reverse reads sequence quality scores reversed every output read now forward. stored columns called \"forward_sequence\" \"forward_quality\". See reverse_sequence_if_needed() reverse_quality_if_needed() documentation details reversing implemented. reverse_complement_mode character. Whether reverse-complemented sequences converted DNA (.e. complements T) RNA (.e. complements U). Must either \"DNA\" \"RNA\". affects reverse-complemented sequences. Sequences forward begin altered.
