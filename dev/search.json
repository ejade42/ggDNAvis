(Note: index_annotation_vertical_position 1, 1 additional blank line inserted, according ceiling(index_annotation_vertical_position)). Annotating line look follows:  annotate final line family, can look sequences vector: can see lines 14, 28, 51 last sequence family, annotate lines (also enable annotating first base line):  visualise_single_sequence(), frequency annotations along line controlled index_annotation_interval. Additionally, configurable whether annotations continue end image (index_annotation_full_line = TRUE, default) stop annotated sequence ends (index_annotation_full_line = FALSE). Annotating every line every 3 bases sequence ends look follows:  annotating end image regardless sequence ends look follows: Note blank/spacing lines also annotated, index_annotation_full_line = FALSE don’t display anything sequence (however, additional spacers still inserted make room theoretical annotations).  Customising colour, size, vertical position annotations works exactly visualise_single_sequence() via index_annotation_colour, index_annotation_size, index_annotation_vertical_position respectively: (make text much bigger margin also need increasing prevent top text cut ).
