# ggDNAvis: 'ggplot2'-Based Tools for Visualising DNA Sequences and Modifications

Uses 'ggplot2' to visualise either (a) a single DNA/RNA sequence split
across multiple lines, (b) multiple DNA/RNA sequences, each occupying a
whole line, or (c) base modifications such as DNA methylation called by
modified bases models in Dorado or Guppy. Functions starting with
visualise\_\<something\>() are the main plotting functions, and
functions starting with extract\_\<something\>() are key helper
functions for reading files and reformatting data. Source code is
available at <https://github.com/ejade42/ggDNAvis> and a full non-expert
user guide is available at <https://ejade42.github.io/ggDNAvis/>.
